One may want to [[customize]] her image before building.

Every following command must be run as `root`, at the root of the
source directory one has [[downloaded|download]].

For the impatient ones:

	$ git clone git://git.immerda.ch/amnesia.git
	$ cd amnesia
	$ sudo su
	# lh config
	# lh build

Details
=======

Dependencies
------------

* `live-helper` 2.0~a11 or newer, from Squeeze or from Debian Live
  snapshot packages: see the
  [Debian Live manual](http://live.debian.net/manual/html/) for details.
* A patched ikiwiki is needed so that the static version of the wiki
  included in the image has correct links to the online wiki; see this
  [wishlist item](http://ikiwiki.info/todo/mirrorlist_with_per-mirror_usedirs_settings/)
  to get the custom ikiwiki branch that has the needed code. It is
  not critical to do so.
* If `syslinux` > 3.72 is installed, the built ISO images are
  converted to hybrid ones: they can be either a CD-ROM or a hard disk
  (USB disk, etc.).

Build process
-------------

Initialize the Live system's configuration with `lh config`:

	lh config

Most `lh config` options are supported.

You can then run the standard live-helper commands as root to build
the image (`lh build`) and to cleanup the build directory (`lh
clean`).
