One may want to [[customize]] her image before building.

Every following command must be run as `root`, at the root of the
source directory one has [[downloaded|download]].

For the impatient ones:

	$ git clone git://git.immerda.ch/amnesia.git
	$ cd amnesia
	$ sudo su
	# lb config
	# lb build

Dependencies
============

* `live-build` 2.0.1; T(A)ILS code is usually tested against Squeeze's
  live-build, but a sid or Debian Live snapshot package can sometimes
  be needed during a development cycle:  see the [Debian Live
  manual](http://live.debian.net/manual/html/) for details.
* `syslinux` >= 4.01, so that the built ISO images are
  converted to hybrid ones: they can be either a CD-ROM or a hard disk
  (USB disk, etc.).
* A patched ikiwiki is needed so that the static version of the wiki
  included in the image has correct links to the online wiki; see this
  [wishlist item](http://ikiwiki.info/todo/mirrorlist_with_per-mirror_usedirs_settings/)
  to get the custom ikiwiki branch that has the needed code. It is
  not critical to do so.

Build process
=============

Initialize the Live system's configuration with `lb config`.
Most `lb config` options are supported, have a look to the `lb_config`
manpage for details.

You can then use the standard live-build commands as root to build
the image (`lb build`) and to cleanup the build directory (`lb
clean`).
