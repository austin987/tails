One may want to [[customize]] her image before building.

Every following command must be run as `root`, at the root of the
source directory one has [[downloaded|download]].

For the impatient ones:

	$ git clone git://git.immerda.ch/amnesia.git
	$ cd amnesia
	$ sudo su
	# lh config
	# lh build

Dependencies
------------

* `live-helper` 2.0~a3+20100112.043645 or newer: the
  [Debian Live manual](http://live.debian.net/manual/html/) explains
  how to install a snapshot package.
* A patched ikiwiki is probably needed; see this
  [wishlist item](http://ikiwiki.info/todo/mirrorlist_with_per-mirror_usedirs_settings/)
  to get the custom ikiwiki branch that has the needed code.
* if `syslinux` > 3.72 is installed, the built ISO images are
  converted to hybrid ones: they can be either a CD-ROM or a hard disk
  (USB disk, etc.)

Build process
-------------

Initialize the Live system's configuration with `lh config`:

	lh config

Most `lh config` options are supported.

You can then run the standard live-helper commands as root to build
the image (`lh build`) and to cleanup the build directory (`lh
clean`).
