<p><em>If you look at the way post-2013 whistleblowers have been caught,
it is clear the absolute most important thing you can do to maintain
your anonymity is reduce the number of places in your operational
activity where you can make mistakes. Tor and Tails still do precisely
that.</em></p>

<p><em>Tails expands Tor's protections to an entire operating system, and

is a favorite companion tool of Tor.</em></p>
