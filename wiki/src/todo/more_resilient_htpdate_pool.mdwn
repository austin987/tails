The following servers have sometimes been hard to reach in the past:

* mail.riseup.net ("privacy friends" pool)
* ssl.scroogle.org ("neutral" pool)

The servers in the Tails HTP pool were selected, among other criteria,
using the total page weight one, resources (CSS, images, etc.)
included, which should not count anymore since we currently only fetch
page headers.

This allows us to pick other, more reliable servers to replace the two
aforementioned ones, e.g. :

* "privacy friends" pool: replace mail.riseup.net with www.eff.org
* "neutral" pool: replace ssl.scroogle.org with en.wikipedia.org
