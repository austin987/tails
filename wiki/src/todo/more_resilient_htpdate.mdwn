htpdate fails too easy in paranoid mode: only one of the servers need
a problem before we fail, which has occured due to server problems twice
already (riseup and scroogle).

Instead we should allow htpdate to fail some specified number of
number of times for each pool (trusted, neutral and adversarial)
before aborting. The pools should be allowed to be of any size so we
they should be configured in a file, not passed on the command line
(which also makes it easier to separate the different pools. We should
pick some specified number of sources randomly from each pool. Large
pools are good, both for resilience (if there are broken sources they
are only picked with some small probability) and security (if there
are compromised sources they are only picked with some small
probability).
