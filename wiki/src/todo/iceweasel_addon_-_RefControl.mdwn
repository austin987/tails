This is what's said about
[RefControl](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/953) in the
[Torbutton FAQ](https://www.torproject.org/torbutton/torbutton-faq.html.en#recommendedextensions):

> [...] this extension allows more fine-grained referrer spoofing than
  Torbutton currently provides. It should break less sites than
  Torbutton's referrer spoofing option.

As the http referer (sic!) can be used to track users to some extent,
we should try to do something about it. And, indeed, RefControl
manages this with its 3rd party spoofing without breaking many sites
(examples of broken sites?).

Configuration
=============

Torbutton should be configured to not use its referrer
spoof. RefControl should be configured to use "Forge (3rd Party)" per
default. This will make RefControl spoof the http referer only when
following links across domains (i.e. to a 3rd party domain) but leave
it unchanged when following links within the same domain. When
spoofed, the referer is set to the base domain of the link
(i.e. a.com/b becomes a.com).

torRefSpoofer in Torbutton 1.3.0alpha
=====================================

Someone already published a patch to add a 'smart' referrer spoofing that does
not add spoofing when navigating to a page from the same domain or host.

See [[http://github.com/koryk/Torbutton/commit/679c06370921097f2c38d564b87e4a1149ff6914]]

And this has been merged upstream on version 1.3.0-alpha.

See [[https://gitweb.torproject.org/torbutton.git/commit/6d8932396b026b7db3b6bbb1434a8760136a6e94]]

This adds three options to the Tor button preferences:

  - spoofblank: Spoof blank referer during Tor usage (may break some sites).
  - smartspoof: Smart referer spoof during Tor usage (spoofs cross domain
    referers), then the referer is spoofed unless we're on the same domain or
    the same host.
  - nospoof: No referer spoof during Tor usage (sends referers as normal).

I conducted a bunch of tests on the new refSpoofer feature from version
1.3.0alpha and open a ticket on our name on the Torproject's track.
See [[!tor_bug 2148]]. 
This bug was fixed, we now need to wait for a stable
Torbutton 1.3 release is published and available in Debian.
