sajolida reports:

- it seems to happen after using the liveusb-creator
- it happened on both Tails 0.10.1 and Tails experimental
- sometimes it happens while doing:
  - boot Tails experimental on a isohybrid
  - "Clone Tails" onto another stick
  - unplug the running Tails
- sometimes the screen turns black with a cursor on the top-left
  corner and nothing else
- sometimes the screen stays the same, the system is still somehow
  responsive but doesn't shutdown
- once I couldn't even shutdown with the red button or by doing `sudo
  halt` in a terminal once I reached this weird state
- once I checked and udev-watchdog was still running on the right
  device but the emergency shutdown still didn't work

intrigeri confirms: On VT1, when unplugging my boot USB stick, I see
various lines about sdb3, sdb2 and sdb1 being removed, followed by
"Bus error". Nothing more happens, and the udev watchdog process is
not there anymore.
