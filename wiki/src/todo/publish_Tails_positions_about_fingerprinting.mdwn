Now that we have discussed fingerprinting, we should extract our
positions on this topic, make it fit for publication, and publish it.

* We want to switch to Torbrowser
* Improve fingerprinting on both exit node & ISP sides

Places that need updating:

* [[contribute/design]]
* [[todo/replace_iceweasel_with_Torbrowser]]
* [[doc/about/warning]] page should point to those positions
