We need to distribute the source of what we ship inside Tails binary
images, which basically means:

- the source for included Debian packages
- the source for Debian packages that are used at build-time to
  compile binary files, but not shipped inside the chroot (e.g. some
  `-dkms` packages, probably)

[[!toc levels=2]]

# Roadmap

1. As an intermediary step, we must offer to provide the source
   upon request. [[!tag todo/documentation]]
2. On the long run, we probably want something better.
   We must decide what path we choose.
   Let's first list pros & cons of the various solutions
   in more details. [[!tag todo/research]]

# Possible implementations

## live-build --source

live-build's `--source` option allows to build a source image
corresponding to the binary image that is being built. The default
source image format is tar.

It would not be too much work to upload such a source image along with
a newly released Tails ISO. On the other hand:

- our sometimes scarse upload bandwidth would feel even more painful
  that it currently does;
- on the long run, doing this without any de-duplication would waste
  big amounts of storage space, especially considering a big set of
  packages is shared between quite a few Tails releases, during a
  given Debian stable release life-cycle.

## reprepro

Our own [[contribute/APT repository]] uses reprepro.
reprepro knows how to
partially mirror APT repositories, so we could use it to inject, at
release time, the needed list of source packages.

## direct offer of source upon request

See [Finnix and GPL
compliance](http://blog.finnix.org/2011/08/21/finnix-and-gpl-compliance/).

The relevant parts of the GPL are section 3(b) of the GPLv2 and
section 6(b) of the GPLv3.

## grml source-report

See their
[Gitweb](http://git.grml.org/?p=grml-infrastructure.git;a=tree;f=source-report).
Seems clever, as usual.
