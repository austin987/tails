The items of the **Tails** menu are duplicated in the **System Tools**
menu.

The **Tails** menu exists thanks to:

  config/chroot_local-includes/usr/share/desktop-directories/Tails.directory

But at .deb creation or installation time (it's not clear at which exact
step this is blocking), it does not exist yet, so at least one existing
menu must be listed in the application (t-p-s etc.) .desktop file, and
that's why they've been to the System Tools menu as well.

This issue could be solved in two ways:

  1. Finding a way of having them only in the Tails menu.
  2. Removing the Tails menu as a workaround.
