Bug reports
===========

bug #1
------

When the --partition option is not passed, liveusb-creator must take
into account the existing Live OS will be deleted, once the user
agreed to do so:

    If you continue, this will be overwritten.
    Press 'Create Live USB' again if you wish to continue.
    Verifying filesystem...
    Not enough free space on device.
    677MB ISO + 0MB overlay > 300MB free space

This is supposed to be done already, thanks to
`self.live.delete_liveos()` being run in `gui.py`, so shall be tested
again and fixed if necessary.

Partitions
==========

- Don't ask to confirm before resetting the MBR when using
  `--partition`: done in 5028cb0, but untested.
- if stick size <1.5GB, error out in a user-friendly way

Misc.
=====

- UI: make it more clear when the user must confirm
  Rename the "Create" button to "Forward" or "Go on"?
  Add the "go forward" icon to the button?
- .desktop file uses `Icon=fedorausb.png` => use a more generic icon
- write a simple GUI that resets a USB stick that previously contained
  a isohybrid Tails to a sane state
  OR document with nice screenshots how to do so on GNOME / Windows

Upgrade
=======

Until we support incremental updates (see
[[todo/usb_install_and_upgrade]] for details), our installer must
allow upgrading a (non-running) Tails that is installed on a removable
device. The existing code should already support this, but we need to
double-check this and possibly wrap that feature, UI-wise, in a way
that properly support this usecase. Putting ourselves in the situation
of documenting how to use our installer to perform an upgrade may be a
good way to detect remaining problems.

Input
=====

- test installing from ISO file while running a Tails system
- test cloning from USB on bare metal
- test cloning from CD on bare metal

Distribution
============

Debian
------

- make te Debian packaging good enough to be shipped in Tails

Documentation
=============

- update [[todo/usb_install_and_upgrade]] with current decisions and
  plans
- update [[download and installation|download]] documentation

Later
=====

* If stick is <1.5GB case, support installing but don't show the
  persistence checkbox
* Allow setting the system/overlay partitions size via command-line
  option(s).
* Add Tails to the downloadable images list.
* Allow vendors to set
  - default release to download
  - list of downloadable files
* GPG signature verification
  - verify GPG signatures delivered with iso images (see verify_iso_sha1 called in gui.py)
  - Debian provides gpgv-win32 that can be used on Windows
- command-line option --local-hard-disks that would enable
  installation on local hard disks (= not external USB);
  seems to be implemented by --force, see special casing in the
  detect_removable_devices method.

Windows support?
----------------

As [[documented already|doc/installing_onto_a_usb_stick/windows]],
the basic Tails install onto a USB stick from Windows is already easy
to do.

Therefore, even if our installer does not run on Windows / until it
does, those who want to get a "standard" install of Tails on USB can
either burn a CD or use a "basic" install of Tails on USB, and then
run our installer in clone mode from Tails.

Proper Windows support would be welcome, though.

Try http://www.pyinstaller.org/ to create a single binary file for
Windows and for OS X. Include those binaries on Tails images?
