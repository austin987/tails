[[!tag todo/easy]]

A set of boot splash screen / Desktop theme / iceweasel theme that
mimic Microsoft Windows and Internet Explorer would be nice when using
a public computer in order to raise less suspicion.

# Next things to do

- look at what Windows XP, Vista and Seven look like
- [[!taglink todo/research]] suitable themes
- [[!taglink todo/discuss]] whether we want this to be the default or
  a opt-in option (in tails-greeter? too late? earlier?)

# Resources

- tested, works quite well on 0.6.2. should [[!taglink todo/test]] in 0.7
- 1.2MB compressed once the duplicated files are removed from the
  tarball
- bugs:
 * desktop wallpaper is set to mozaic mode
 * mouse-on-dropbox => invisible text
 * probably more
