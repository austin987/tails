Rationale: Tails 0.7.x is known to boot fine and "work" for hours for
basic web browsing on a computer with 512MB RAM. However, it hangs as
soon as too many tabs are open / applications are run. The recommended
amount of memory to seriously run Tails is therefore 1GB.

Many users ask us, confused, why "OpenOffice does not start",
or "iceweasel randomly closes".

Tails should therefore notify the user when booting it on a computer
that does not meet the hardware recommandations. This notification
would be printed somewhere on the [[tails-greeter|todo/TailsGreeter]]
([[todo/boot_menu]]) screen.
