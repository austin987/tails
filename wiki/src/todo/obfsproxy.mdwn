The [Obfsproxy](https://tails.boum.org/todo/obfsproxy/) project exists
to achieve the benefits of Tor's bridges together with traffic
obfuscation.

# Use cases

## Censorship circumvention

Since bridges are easily detected and blocked in some areas (in
particular China, but also places where wholesale SSL blocking is
used), something like obfsproxy is needed in Tails.

## Hiding Tor usage

In situations where both reliability *and* obfuscation are required
despite an adversary having control of the user's local network
*traffic obfuscation* must also be employed. This traffic obfuscation
is **imperative** where the user's welfare or liberty my be
jeopardised by her use of Tor.

# Implementation

The branch `feature/obfsproxy` currently adds rudimentary support for
obfsproxy. It's possible to just add a bridge like `obfs2 $IP:$PORT`
through Vidalia's settings and it works (also works with
[[bridge-mode|todo/bridge_support]]).

# Future

A complete TBB+Obfsproxy bundle is available from the project's
page. The default configuration file is set to connect via a selection
of preconfigured obfs2 bridges. It all just works<sup>tm</sup>. Is
shipping such a static list of bridges something we want to consider
for Tails? It completely contradicts the "Hiding Tor usage"
requirement, but such users could opt-out of using the static list and
instead have to input bridges manually, as is currently the case when
using [[bridge-mode|todo/bridge_support]].
