For various reasons, we want to ship Iceweasel 5.x or newer in Tails.

Our `feature/ff4` Git branch installs Iceweasel 5.x from the Debian
Mozilla team's APT repository.

Next things to do
=================

[[!tag todo/code]]

Most of our extensions are compatible with FF4, but are not marked
as compatible with FF5; namely: 

- FoxyProxy: sid's 2.22.6-1 is compatible with FF4, but not marked as
  compatible with FF5
- HTTPS-Everywhere: need to be upgraded to at least 0.9.7 to be
  compatible with FF4+; no idea for FF5
- Monkeysphere 0.6 is compatible with FF4, but is not marked as
  compatible with FF5

Some other extensions are in a much worse state wrt. FF4+:

- CS Lite 1.4: unmaintained, not compatible with FF4+, needs to be
  upgraded or replaced, see [[todo/iceweasel_addon_-_CS_Lite]]
- FireGPG presumably does not work in FF4+; work [[is being
  done|todo/symmetric_OpenPGP_vs_recent_Iceweasel]] to find a solution.

Some others must be looked at:

[[!tag todo/test]]

- xul-ext-adblock-plus

Blocking
========

[[!tag todo/wait]]

We won't ship Iceweasel 5.x until a released stable Torbutton supports
it. Let's wait.
