This is something we may, or may not, want to support once other
[[persistence]] usecases are supported.

This would give users fine-grained control of the system and
possibility to set it up exactly after their own expectations.

All the problems of a persistent /home applies but are amplified
to a system-wide scale, for instance

- users can also break the firewall-based Tor enforcement
- sensitive information will leak outside of /home, like to
  /tmp, /var/log etc.
- get a persistent virus or other malware
- Tails upgrades would be near-impossible without breaking stuff.
