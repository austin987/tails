Do we want to support bluetooth somehow, or disable it
more drastically? Enabling it would enable the use of some hardware,
but what security / anonymity / privacy issues would it have?
Beside, how much enabled is it already?

See [[forum/Is there any bluetooth manager to set up mobile gprs?]].

Roadmap
=======

0. [[!taglink todo/wait]] generic implementation: plans on
   [[todo/protect_against_external_bus_memory_forensics]].
0. See what packages we should ship to support bluetooth hardware, for
   those who need it.
