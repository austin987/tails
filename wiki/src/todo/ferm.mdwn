From [ferm](http://ferm.foo-projects.org/)'s description:

    ferm is a frontend for iptables. It reads the rules from a
    structured configuration file and calls iptables(8) to insert them
    into the running kernel.

    ferm's goal is to make firewall rules easy to write and easy to
    read. It tries to reduce the tedious task of writing down rules, thus
    enabling the firewall administrator to spend more time on developing
    good rules than the proper implementation of the rule.

    To achieve this, ferm uses a simple but powerful configuration
    language, which allows variables, functions, arrays, blocks. It also
    allows you to include other files, allowing you to create libraries
    of commonly used structures and functions.

Our firewall rules (currently using the very unsophisticated
iptables-save/restore format) could certainly benefit from this.

The firewall present in `feature/firewall_lockdown` has been rewritten
in the `feature/use_ferm` branch. The later is to be rebased and
finished once [[feature/firewall_lockdown|firewall_lockdown]] is merged
in `devel`.
