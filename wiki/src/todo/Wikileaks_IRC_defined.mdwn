It would be useful, if secure.wikileaks.org:9999 with SLL is defined in Pidgin by default. See http://wikileaks.org/wiki/Chat for more info. I would suggest to generate different random username for wikileaks.org (actually different for all pre-defined servers to exclude some possibility that somebody notices the same user popping up on different servers).

I don't know what others think, but I don't want Pidgin to autoconnect to any pre-defined server (irc.otfc.net in this case)
