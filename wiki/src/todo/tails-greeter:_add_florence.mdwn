In order to protect users against encryption passphrase and sudo
password compromise in the presence of a hardware keyboard logger, the
Florence Virtual Keyboard should be available in Tails Greeter.

# Implementation research

A proof of concept has been implemented :

- add florence.desktop to gdm greeter session
- florence needs a system tray to enable user to access its icon, so,
  install trayer and add a corresponding `.desktop` to gdm
  greeter session.

This works, but a solution which does not require to display another panel has to be found.

> Why do we "have" to find another solution?
> If we really have, how hard would it be to have the existing
> tails-greeter panel act as a system tray?
