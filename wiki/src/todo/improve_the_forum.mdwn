Let's switch to a more advanced Question & Answer webapp instead!

[[!toc levels=2]]

Roadmap
=======

0. import worthy old posts into ask.torproject.org (Ague as a nice
   setup to select these, should be documented somewhere we can easily
   find it when needed)
0. adapt our website to point to the new place
0. remove the old forum

Required features
=================

- Allow to vote for the answers and display the answer sorted by votes.
- Allow to ask questions anonymously.
- Handle karma for logged in users.
- Have decently smart email notifications.
- By default, proposes to search before asking a new question.

Candidates
==========

OSQA
----

In the end OSQA might not be the good solution.

  - They did [some releases](http://www.osqa.net/blog/) quite quickly
    between 2010 and March 2011, but nothing since then.
  - The [developers mailing
    list](http://lists.osqa.net/pipermail/lists.osqa.net/dev/) has been
    almost dead since the last release.
  - There are [some](https://github.com/BinaryRage/OSQA/commits/master)
    [people](https://github.com/cdman/OSQA/commits/master) still
    developing it somehow on github though not on a regular basis.
  - People working on OSQA started their own business with
    [Answerhub](http://answerhub.com/). And it seems like they are not
    really working on OSQA anymore.
  - Officially they are still supporting OSQA, and there indeed are some
    recent commits in the subversion but way less than before: 510
    (2011), 60 (2012).

At first, we selected OSQA for the following reasons:

  - Django application.
  - Shows the ‘Search’ button first by default and the ‘Ask a question’
    button on the side.
  - Easy to install: checkout the source code, install all the
    dependencies from Debian: `python-django-south python-django
    python-django-debug-toolbar python-markdown python-html5lib
    python-openid` (instead of using easy_install), configure the
    desired server to use WSGI, create the DB and that's it.
    <http://wiki.osqa.net/display/docs/Ubuntu+with+Apache+and+MySQL>
  - We will host it under http://tails.boum.org/ask/.

Askbot
------

  - <http://askbot.org/>
  - Another Django webapp, forked from OSQA.
  - <https://github.com/ASKBOT/askbot-devel>
  - Has [many dependencies](https://github.com/ASKBOT/askbot-devel/blob/master/askbot_requirements.txt) outside of Debian:
    - akismet
    - coffin
    - django-keyedcache
    - django-robots
    - django-kombu
    - django-followit
    - django-recaptcha-works
    - markdown2
    - pystache
    - pytz
    - longusername
  - The test installation did not succeeded because of many issues on
    database support, and migration during installation.
  - Most of the development is [done by 2
    people](https://github.com/ASKBOT/askbot-devel/graphs/contributors),
    they are also selling it as a service.
  - The commit count looks promising: 393 (2009), 594 (2010), 1249
    (2011), 1106 (2012)
  - Bug tracker: <http://bugs.askbot.org/projects/askbot/>, but are they
    really using it?

### Features

  - Anonymous posting: like for OSQA, filling up the email field is
    required but the validity of the email is not checked.
  - Email notifications:
    - *Asked by me*
    - *Answered by me*
    - *Individually selected*
    - *Entire forum (tag filtered)*
    - *Comments and posts mentioning me*
  - List matching questions on the fly when typing a new question.
  - The software is
    [translated](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/askbot/) but there
    is no multilingual support from the web interface.
  - No group feature.

Shapado
-------

  - <http://shapado.com>
  - Written in Ruby
  - <https://gitorious.org/shapado>
  - More or less standard Rails app. Uses MongoDB. See
    [[!debbug 633407]] regarding Debian support. See
    <https://gitorious.org/shapado/shapado/merge_requests/17> for up-to-date
    documentation.
  - Upstream does not often runs the product outside the 'shapado.com'
    environment. A few tweaks were needed to get the application
    running.
  - Developers tools: IRC channel, bug tracking through questions on
    Shapado.com.
  - Pivotal Tracker, but not used anymore?
    <https://www.pivotaltracker.com/projects/74584#>
  - Most of the development is done by 3 people, probably the people
    behind <http://ricodigo.com/>, the company running shapado.com.
  - Last release in September 2011, and no official release since then.
    The commit count dropped, but there is still recent activity: 730
    (2009), 2276 (2010), 1832 (2011), 344 (2012)

### Features

  - Anonymous posting:
    - Like for OSQA, filling up the email field is required but the
      validity of the email is not checked.
    - Setting `Enable Anonymous` for a group, but that only allows
      people logged in to answer a question without showing their
      username.
  - Email notifications:
    - *Get email notifications for new answers*
    - *Receive email notifications about questions in your field of
      expertise*
    - *Receive email notifications about system activities such as
      earned badges, new followers, etc*
    - *Receive a report with latest group activity (only for group
      admins)*
  - When something is typed in the 'Ask a question' form,
    the current set of matching questions are displayed on the fly.
    Maybe an intermediate screen will be better if anything is found.
  - Group feature:
    - User can join different groups with a single login.
    - Some code is present to move a question from one group to another,
      but it seems broken.
    - Group can be tied to one or more languages.
  - Multilingual support with user settings such as:
    - *Language used for the interface of the site*, that works.
    - *You want to read questions in the following languages*, works but
      is buggy: the default language for the group (English) doesn't
      show up in the list of languages when asking a question, nor in
      the filter when listing questions.
  - Weird limitation on password size: `Password is too long (maximum is
    20 characters)`.
  - Browser compatibility: I faced some issues while signing up, login
    in, or joining a group. But all that seems to work fine from Tails.
  - Unable to vote on questions?

Q2A
---

  - <http://www.question2answer.org/>
  - Written in PHP
  - <https://github.com/q2a/question2answer> but only one commit per
    release!
  - No dependencies outside of PHP and MySQL
  - No public developers tools?
    <http://www.question2answer.org/qa/3665/can-find-q2a-project-repository-anywhere-like-sourceforge>
  - Many plugins by the community:
    <http://www.question2answer.org/addons.php>
  - Four releases in 2012

### Features

  - Anonymous posting: like the others, need registration but no real
    check on the email address.
  - Categories, see <http://frageee.de/>
  - Only translatable, no multilingual support
  - Markdown editor, as a plugin:
    <http://codelair.co.uk/11/markdown-editor-plugin-q2a>
  - Captcha, as a plugin
    <https://github.com/KrzysztofKielce/q2a-captcha-antibot>
  - Email notifications, as a plugin with minimal features (no
    subscription, not handling categories, etc.)
    <https://github.com/sawtoothsoftware/Q2A-Email-Notifications>
  - Question2Answer Network Sites, a plugin to link a network of Q2A
    site, including the possibility of migrating questions between sites
    of a same farm (experimental).

Others
------

  - [Reddit](https://github.com/reddit/reddit), not really Q&A.

Things to be done on the Q&A application
========================================

  - Have a ‘hardware’ tag.
  - Encourage people to use the appropriate ways to report bugs, and
    get better support this way, proposal:
    “You are much more likely to get help with hardware related issues,
    and bugs, if you report them using WhisperBack. See
    [[doc/first_steps/bug_reporting]]".
  - Make the submission of an email optional when registering.
  - Get the source code in a Git repository using `git-svn`.
