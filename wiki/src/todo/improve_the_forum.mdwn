Let's migrate to [ask.torproject.org](https://ask.torproject.org/)
instead.

[[!toc levels=2]]

Tor made it available in March 2013, it is based on Askbot.

<https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/5995>

Roadmap
=======

0. Test and report our findings about ask.torproject.org [[!taglink todo/test]]
   - How are we going to filter Tails content?
   - Do we need to be granted special rights as Tails dev?
   - Comments to be made:
     - Search engine is too strict ("turtles" → 2 threads, but "turtles question" → 0 threads)
     - Anonymous posting is not working
     - What are the criteria to go through moderation?
0. Create ourselves accounts on ask.torproject.org
0. Wait for ask.torproject.org to be announced and used.
0. Close the current forum for new posts and redirect to ask.torproject.org
0. Sort out the interesting content of the forum in the doc/sort_the_forum branch
   Here's how to do it, for each forum thread in `wiki/src/forum/':

       If the question is relevant and was answered well enough
       Then
           move the question and best answer to wiki/src/forum2migrate
           (with git mv)
       Else
          delete the whole thread (with git rm)

       >From time to time, merge from master branch to get the new threads.
       >From time to time, send us a pull request so that your work is
        integrated into the main doc/sort_the_forum branch, and so that work
        is not duplicated.

       I'm told using mc helps in the process.

0. Adapt our website to point to the new place.
   Encourage people to use the appropriate ways to report bugs, and
   get better support this way, proposal:
   “You are much more likely to get help with hardware related issues,
   and bugs, if you report them using WhisperBack. See
   [[doc/first_steps/bug_reporting]]".
0. Remove the old forum.

Askbot
======

The service ask.torproject.org is using Askbot.

  - <http://askbot.org/>
  - Django webapp, forked from OSQA.
  - <https://github.com/ASKBOT/askbot-devel>
  - Has [many dependencies](https://github.com/ASKBOT/askbot-devel/blob/master/askbot_requirements.txt) outside of Debian:
    - akismet
    - coffin
    - django-keyedcache
    - django-robots
    - django-kombu
    - django-followit
    - django-recaptcha-works
    - markdown2
    - pystache
    - pytz
    - longusername
  - Most of the development is [done by 2
    people](https://github.com/ASKBOT/askbot-devel/graphs/contributors),
    they are also selling it as a service.
  - The commit count looks promising: 393 (2009), 594 (2010), 1249
    (2011), 1106 (2012)

### Features

  - Anonymous posting: filling up the email field is
    required but the validity of the email is not checked.
  - Email notifications:
    - *Asked by me*
    - *Answered by me*
    - *Individually selected*
    - *Entire forum (tag filtered)*
    - *Comments and posts mentioning me*
  - List matching questions on the fly when typing a new question.
  - The software is
    [translated](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/askbot/) but there
    is no multilingual support from the web interface.
  - No subsite feature.

### Wishlist

  * Add multilanguage feature to:
    - allow users to change the language of the interface they see
    - allow to filter the content by the language of the questions
  * Add a subsite feature:
    - a single login should allow to post on different subsites
    - a single user might have different credentials, karmas and badges
      in different subsites
    - allow to move questions between subsites (if allowed to do so)
    - subsites can be tied to one or more languages (see multilanguage)

Browse the forum using mc
=========================

Using <span class="application">mc</span>, the GNU Midnight Commander,
you can then browse the forum content by chronological order.

  - Move to the `forum` folder.
  - Run the [[`restore_mtime.sh`|improve_the_forum/restore_mtime.sh]]
    script that updates the modification time of both the original post
    and the folder containing the corresponding comments to the date of
    the original post, retrieved through Git.
  - Start mc in the `forum` folder.
  - To mix both directories and file in the file listing, press F9 and
    choose Options → Panel options... → Mix all files.
  - To sort files by modify time, press F9 and choose Left → Sort order
    → Modify time.
  - To have a preview of files in the right panel, press F9 and choose
    Right → Quick view.
