Now that [[doc/first_steps/persistence]] exists, it makes sense to
ship a feature-full password manager: a full password management
system does a lot more than GNOME Keyring, and has more sophisticated
security features, e.g. copying masked strings, auto-lock of the db,
expiration notifications, etc.

A good password management system may be core to helping users "do the
right thing".

# Roadmap

It looks like KeePassX is the best bet.

This is worked on in the `feature/install-password-manager` branch.

[[!taglink todo/done]] in Tails 0.17.

# Which one?

It would be great it some level of system integration was possible
(e.g. at least a taskbar icon, possibly using GTK, ideally
transparently replacing GNOME Keyring).

## KeePass

* [[!debpts keepass2]]
* in Wheezy, but not in Squeeze
* popcon: 500
* depends on Mono libraries that are neither in Tails nor in Squeeze yet
* GNOME3?

## KeePassX

* [[!debpts keepassx]]
* in Squeeze and Wheezy
* popcon: 2800
* depends on Qt4 libraries that are shipped in Tails already
* cross-platform (Windows)
* minimizes fine in GNOME3's notification area
* in Tails 0.15: works fine, including autotype feature

## Figaro's Password Manager 2

* [[!debpts fpm2]]
* in Squeeze and Wheezy
* popcon: 250
* no dependencies but basic GTK-2 and X libraries
* GNOME3?

## revelation

* [[!debpts revelation]]
* in Squeeze and Wheezy
* popcon: 500
* maintenance in Debian looks sub-optimal
* [not compatible with
  GNOME3](http://oss.codepoet.no/revelation/issue/55/applet-incompatible-with-gnome-3)
