[[!meta title="Better internal hard disks lockdown"]]

Tails user can currently access their local hard disks. It is only possible
when an administrative password is set at boot time, but still it would
be better to make internal drives read-only at kernel level to prevent
anything bad from happening, unless explicitly desired. The later
is useful to wipe a file or the whole device.

About implementation: live-boot's `readonly` option does the read-only
part, but it does that for every device, including removable ones,
which is painful when using [[todo/persistence]] stored on the USB
stick Tails is running from. We need to add a `readonly=fixed`
option to live-boot that would do that only for fixed (internal)
disks.

Once that is done, an option must be added to get write access back. Either
in Tails Greeter or on the command-line.
