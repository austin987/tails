Two probably related 0.14 regressions:

* pressing the DVD reader eject button neither ejects the DVD, nor
  triggers the emergency shutdown procedure
* [[forum/0.14-rc1_-_DVD_won't_eject_before_wiping_of_RAM_during_shutdown_process]]

It might be that the old inverted logic bug that forced us to pretend
to *lock* the DVD eject button in order to effectively *unlock* it,
was fixed. Who knows.

Next steps

[[!taglink todo/test]] replacing `eject -i on` with `eject -i off`
in `config/chroot_local-includes/usr/local/sbin/udev-watchdog-wrapper`.
