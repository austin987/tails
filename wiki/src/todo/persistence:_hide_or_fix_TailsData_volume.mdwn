* The volume TailsData shows up in the Places menu but when clicking
  on it I get "Unable to mount TailsData /dev/dm-0 is mounted". I guess
  that's no big surprise but then it should either be removed from the
  Places menu or open the folder where it is mounted
 (/live/persistent/sdb2_unlocked) if we think that makes sense.
