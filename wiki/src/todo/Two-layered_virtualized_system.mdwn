This is an "unfunded mandate", I'm afraid; I can't work on this. And
it's a reasonable amount of work.

It is, however, based on a long, long acquaintance with the problem
space. This is something I was thinking about doing for the old
Zero-Knowledge Freedom system back in 2000, because of bugs we kept
finding and attacks we kept coming up with.

If you want to discuss this, I'm jbash at-sign velvet period com .

# The Problem

A lot of code runs inside amnesia: big programs like Web browsers,
Pidgin (with plugins), OpenOffice (eek!), etc. Each of those programs
will (not may, but definitely will) have security holes that will leak
the real IP address of the machine, and possibly other information.

They will also have holes that will allow remote sites to execute
arbitrary code sent back through Tor connections. This code can then
grovel through /sys, /proc, and wherever else, and extract an endless
number of hardware serial numbers, MAC addresses, unique combinations
of configuration elements, and so forth, any of which may identify the
user's machine to the remote attacker. That's especially true if the
remote attacker is in a position to ask a manufacturer who bought a
given piece of hardware, but that's not the only way of using the
information.

Exploit code can also try to disable or circumvent the local firewall
and send traffic that doesn't go through Tor. There are a lot of
tricks for doing this, especially because all it takes is one packet,
sent from any part of the system, to a chosen destination without
going through Tor.

# The Partial Solution

Split amnesia into two parts: an outer, host part running on the
user's real hardware, and an inner, guest part running in a virtual
machine. Keep all information about the real identity of the user or
the user's computer in the outer machine. Keep all applications in the
inner machine. Mount any storage meant to be writable by the inner
machine as a virtual device provided by the outer machine. If you
encrypt the writable storage, the crypto should probably run on the
outer machine, so that the inner machine doesn't need to have access
to the key.

Ship the entire inner virtual machine image as part of amnesia, so
that each instance is identical in every way that can be seen from
inside... so, for example, the inner machine might always have MAC
address 00:11:22:33:44:55 , and IP address 10.1.2.3.

Make sure that the face presented to the inner machine by the outer
machine is also always the same; for example, the inner machine might
always see the outer machine as a default router at MAC
00:55:44:33:22:11, with an IP address of 10.1.2.1. You don't want any
information about the outer machine to leak to the inner machine via,
say, ARP, or DHCP, or any weird management protocol.

The outer machine should run the hypervisor, and all code that has to
talk to the "real" network: link-layer supplicants, DHCP client, NTP,
Tor itself. The inner machine should be able to connect only to the
Tor port of the outer machine. The outer machine should have a
firewall configured such that no traffic can ever be relayed directly
from the inner machine to the network. The only way the inner machine
can talk to anything should be through Tor.

This includes traffic to the local LAN, BTW; local LAN commmunication
is a huge security hole, because it's usually easy to get a machine on
the local LAN to send something to the outside for you, identifying
the user in the process.

The inner machine can and almost certainly should be aware that it's
talking through a SOCKS proxy. Trying to be transparent using firewall
diversion hacks will probably break more things than it fixes.

# Remaining Holes

This change reduces the attack surface a lot, but it's still subject
to attack through bugs in Tor, bugs in the hypervisor, bugs in the
outer machine's IP stack, and bugs in the kernel on the outer machine.
Oh, and bugs in the hardware. The good news is that you have to crack
the applications before you can attack any of those, so there's some
defense in depth; it takes knowledge of two unpatched bugs, instead of
just one, to actually nail the user.

The hypervisor used should be as simple as possible. I don't know
about Virtualbox, but VMWare is a nightmare of complexity and
guaranteed to be full of holes. qemu might be a better bet than
either, simply because it's not so loaded down with features, and does
fewer things to "help" you (and potentially leak information).

# Interacting With User Virtualization

It's presumably an important use case to have users run amnesia inside
of virtual machines that are part of the users' regular enviroments.
As far as I know, no X86 virtualization system will let you nest VMs,
so that implies that you can't do this trick when amnesia is run under
the user's hypervisor. Probably the "best" solution would be to
reconfigure the user's environment to provide the necessary services
to the amnesia internal virtual machine, but that's also probably an
unsupportable release nightmare. The alternative would be to fall back
to something like the way things work now, with Tor running inside the
virtual machine... but to warn the user that she was operating with
degraded security.
