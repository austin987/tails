Some of our custom shell scripts duplicate code that should be
refactored out to our shell script library
(`config/chroot_local-includes/usr/local/lib/tails-shell-library/`)
that these can included
instead, both for improved code clarity and the usual reasons for
avoiding code duplication.

Left to do:

* extracting long and short language codes from $LANG
  - /usr/local/sbin/unsafe-browser
  - /usr/local/bin/tails-documentation
  - also see [[todo/fix_locales_form_wrong_assumption]]
* Various `wait_until_some_condition_is_met` constructs used here and
  there.
* Greping boot parameters in `/proc/cmdline`.
* Uniform way to start GUI applications from system scripts:
  - `/etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/60-iceweasel.sh`
  - `/usr/local/sbin/restart-vidalia`
