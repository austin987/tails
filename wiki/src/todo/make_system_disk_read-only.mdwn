(Redirected from [[bugs/writable_system_disk:_belongs_to_floppy_group]].)

Tails is affected by [[!debbug 645466]].

In short: the system USB disk and partition block devices (e.g.
`/dev/sdb*`) are writable by the default Live user, because they
belong to the `floppy` group.

This was fixed in Tails 0.12 (see
`config/chroot_local_includes/lib/live/config/998-permissions`) but
the bug has since reappeared so the bug is now reopened. Our `udev`
packages hasn't been updated since, but perhaps the `udev` init script
runs (or re-runs?) after `live-config` wheras it previously only ran
before?

See branch `bugfix/writable_boot_media` for a new fix using `udev`.

> First review done, a bit more [[!taglink todo/code]] is needed.

See also [bilibop](https://un.poivron.org/~quidame/bilibop_project/):
it's potential usefulness for Tails was discussed on the [[!debbug
675467 desc="ITP"]] and [[!debbug 675532 desc="RFS"]] bugs.

Do policykit and udisk take into account the group ownership? Needs to
be tested.

When this bug is fixed, we can re-enable the `the boot device has safe
access rights` step in `features/usb_install.feature` of the automated
test suite.
