Could a more recent browser with support for html5 be included in the
image? There are plenty of html5 supporting browsers that are open
source, and it doesn't have to be the default browser, but html5
replaces a lot of what flash does, without the cost to privacy that
flash carries.

# Implementation

To support the youtube usecase, we additionally need to opt-in for
the html5 experimentation, which requires installing a cookie
(researched at [[!tor_bug 3347]] for TBB).

Automatically adding something like `&webm=1` (or similar) to URLs,
e.g. using a HTTPS-Everywhere custom rule, could be a better
alternative.
