Rationale
=========

The Tor DNS resolver Tails is currently using lacks support for most
types of DNS queries except "A". A better user experience would be
provided if Tails was able to resolve any kind of DNS queries out of
the box.

Implementation
==============

Inserting ttdnsd into the DNS resolver loop is the obvious solution.
ttdnsd listens for UDP DNS requests and forwards these via the Tor
SOCKS proxy to an open recursive DNS resolver on the Internet.

But we cannot just replace pdnsd with ttdnsd as the latter, unlike the
former, does no caching at all. The DNS resolution process could then
be:

    resolv.conf -> DNS forwarding+caching proxy -> ttdnsd -> Tor

Forwarding+caching DNS proxy candidates:

- pdnsd: already installed on Tails
- dnsmasq: very flexible DNS forwarder
- unbound: "recursive-only" caching DNS server which can perform
  DNSSEC validation of results; the DNSSEC feature is appealing; its
  "forward zones" feature seems to allow plugging it into the proposed
  DNS resolution process: forwarding a zone called "." seems
  sufficient; see Haven SVN for examples that may not be working yet
  (as of June 2011, see tor-talk ML)

=> keeping our known-working pdnsd configuration seems to be the safe
choice.

Work is being done on this topic in our
*feature/support_arbitrary_dns_queries* Git branch.

>> The `feature/support_arbitrary_dns_queries` Git branch implements

>>> Tor 0.2.2 is now the official Tor stable tree.
>>> Time to merge.
