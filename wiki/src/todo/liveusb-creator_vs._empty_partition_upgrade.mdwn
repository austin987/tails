Apparently, some users try to use the "upgrade from ISO" option to
install Tails on a blank USB stick partition, and are surprised the
resulting stick does not boot.

I guess we should:

Either add a fourth "install from ISO" option in the launcher, which,
IIRC would be trivial: I believe it's merely another combination of
options to be passed to `liveusb-creator`... and to add to the test
suite, unless we neither document nor support it, perhaps.

Or modify `liveusb-creator` to not allow installing onto an empty
partition unless it's told to setup a MBR too.
