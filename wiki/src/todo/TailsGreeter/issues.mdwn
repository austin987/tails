# Regressions from before tails-greeter

## Should set console keyboard layout


# Bugs

## Wrong initial widget size

E.g. when I select "Français" as a language, presumably because of long
keyboard layout variants names, the combo boxes column grows a lot.
The size of the widgets should be adjusted to the max. possible width
before initial display.

## Text gets hidden when language is selected

Language & layout panel is not autoresized correctly so some of the
widgets (most notably - entry field to test keyboard layout) are
beyond window borders.

## Insane widgets used for long lists

Comboboxes with long lists are hard to use - should be done the same
way as GDM3 in Debian Squeeze: combobox contains default value and
"other..." option, clicking latter will bring up pop-up window with
long scrollable list of options and standard "ok", "cancel" buttons.

## Lacks a way to update .pot/.po files in a batch

Add helper to batch-update all the .po files. Right now manual update
in accordance with instructions in README is required.

Don't setuptools have some gettext features / extension?

setup.py update .pot file. Update of individual .po files from .pot is completely independent task handled by tools like msgmerge.

# Missing features

## Choose keyboard layout independently from the language

It's impossible to choose keyboard layout independently from the
language. Example use-case: X needs to get his GNOME UI in Italian,
because he happens to speak that language much better than English AND
faces an azerty keyboard (e.g. because he's traveling), also he does
not know touch-typing so the keyboard physical and logical layout have
to match.

## Locales should be generated in the background

Once a language is selected, while the user customizes other settings,
the locales should be generated. Login should be blocked (probably
with visual indication that something is going on) until locales
generation is finished.

It's not that simple to implement: t-g is executed as 'Debian-gdm' -
it can't run localedef to generate locale; we have to weight the risk
of sudo / suid vs. the user experience benefits.

Minority report: waiting some time for locale generation to finish every time it's selected might be less preferred for some users than waiting for locale generation on login. Example use-case: user X selects fr_CA locale instead of fr_BE by mistake. In proposed scenario he have to wait for generation of useless locale, than select proper locale and wit for its generation too. All that instead of waiting only once if user's choice is applied during PostLogin.

If TailsGreeter have more than one screen, than locale generation can be started during transition between those screens (if this transition is reversible than additional complexity of tracking multiple subprocesses will be needed).

# Untested features

## Admin credentials

If user have entered password than it should be asked to grant root
access, otherwise root access should be completely disabled. Testing:
"sudo ls" in terminal window should asks for the password and show the
content of the current directory. If user hasn't entered the password
in TailsGreeter than "sudo ls" should report error that user is not in
'sudoers' file. Similarly running "time-admin" utility and pressing
unlock button should allow user to alter time settings (for example -
add pool.ntp.org to the list of servers).

## Second login after user password was set

TailsGreeter uses hardcoded login and
password values. That's why on logout the password is reset back to default value to allow 2nd login even if user password was set during 1st one.
