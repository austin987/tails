Event-based init daemons are [[!debpkg upstart]] and [[!debpkg
systemd]].

There are about 20 interesting calls to `sleep` in the custom scripts
shipped in Tails 0.17. Almost none would be necessary if we were using
an event-based init daemon.

Most of our networking setup (HTP, security check, Tor and Vidalia
restarts) would probably be much simpler and robust if we were using
an event-based init daemon.

We've been wanting to [[todo/supervise_critical_services]] for years,
and e.g. systemd knows how to do that.

systemd is quite well integrated in Debian Wheezy, and has [about
a thousand reported
users](http://qa.debian.org/popcon.php?package=systemd) in Debian as
of February 2012, while Wheezy is not out yet. upstart is not that
well integrated.

The Debian GNOME team intends to ship packages that depend on systemd
in Jessie (mainly because they lack resources to do the work to avoid
that, in a way that would go against upstream somehow -- e.g.
GNOME 3.8 will depend on systemd-logind).

So, we want to switch to systemd once [[Tails is based on
Wheezy|todo/Wheezy]].
