please include Markus Mandalka's (privatix) usbcryptformat tool, as i find it very useful to encrypt usb sticks/disks etc, from a live system. i also think most users would find it useful as well.

same guy's cryptbackup tool, is also another wishlist for me :

>>p.s. thanks for such a quick response with this wishlist.
