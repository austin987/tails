We need to start porting Tails to Wheezy, and test it.

Work is done in the `feature/wheezy` Git branch.

**Current state**: does not build.

[[!toc levels=2]]

Problems to fix
===============

[[!tag todo/code]]

* Fix the build: some of our patches don't apply.
* `amnesia` users sudoers credentials to localize console at profile
  time don't work
* `/usr/local/sbin/udev-watchdog` not found
* `scim-pinyin`, `scim-uim` and `scim-hangul` must be replaced by the Wheezy equivalent
* Persistence for NM connections is broken. See [corresponding issue in
  Liberté](https://github.com/mkdesu/liberte/issues/4)
* Use GNOME fallback mode (but ship GNOME shell too if it's not too
  big -- that will be unsupported, but advanced users might want to
  find their own ways to use it)
* Find and install I2P packages compatible with Wheezy

Tests to do
===========

* is [[bugs/plymouth_stops_too_early]] fixed on Wheezy?
* is [[bugs/desktop_crashes_with_claws-mail_and_gpg-agent]]
  fixed on Wheezy?
* does `liveusb-creator` work fine with both shipped kernels on
  Wheezy? does it work fine *without* our patched `dbus-python`
  package too?
