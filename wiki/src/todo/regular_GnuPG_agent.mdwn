Both [[todo/support_OpenPGP_smartcards]] and
[[todo/fix_claws-mail_with_gpg]] have / are problems caused by
Seahorse, that are fixed by replacing its agent with the regular
GnuPG one and [[!debpts pinentry-gtk2]].

Implemented in `feature/regular-gnupg-agent`.

What would we lose, exactly, by doing that?

> Only answer was: nice UI integration.

[[!taglink todo/done]] in Tails 0.17.
