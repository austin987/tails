Privoxy + Tor configuration examples:

* according to Jacob, the Tor project uses Privoxy when they need
  a HTTP proxy; he sent us a configuration file he trusts to be safe
  using with Tor in the "Switch to Privoxy?" thread on tails-dev (Sun,
  25 Mar 2012 11:12:12 -0700) and another one, based on Liberté's one
  but simplified (Sun, 25 Mar 2012 23:15:11 +0200)
* Orbot uses Privoxy
* Liberté uses Privoxy

> OTOH, best would probably be to simply *remove* Polipo.
> Apart of using torsocks for apt-get and wget, what needs to be done?

>> APT: a rough initial test was done, that added a `tor+http` shim in
>> `/usr/lib/apt/methods` IIRC, to add torsocks in the loop.
>> It worked fairly well, *but* one of the late `live-build` scripts
>> insists on running APT, which fails in this configuration.
