claws-mail.

Done
====

- stop installing icedove and enigmail packages
- install claws packages with pgp plugins
- change the `desktop/gnome/url-handlers/mailto` gconf setting to use
  claws instead of icedove
- $HOME: replace icedove icon in Gnome panel with Claws' one

Left to do
==========

[[!tag todo/code]]
