E.g. <https://twitter.com/codinghorror> does not render is any kind of
usable way on Tails 0.14. No useful information on iceweasel stdout/stderr.

Reproduced on:

* NV50 (nouveau driver), Tails 0.14, default settings
* libvirt (QXL), Tails 0.14, with and without iceweasel hardware
  acceleration enabled
* with Tails 0.13 on VirtualBox
* with Tails 0.13 and unchecking "Use hardware acceleration when available" on
  VirtualBox
* with Tails 0.15~rc1 on VirtualBox
* with Tails 0.15~rc1 and NoScript disabled on VirtualBox

Unreproducible on:

* Debian testing, web browser built from the same source as the Tails
  0.14 one
* Debian sid, iceweasel 10.0.10esr-1 on libvirt (QXL)

TorBrowser Bundle 2.2.39-5 Linux x86_64 is not affected.

Let's [[!taglink todo/test]] if Tails 0.17.x (with iceweasel 17.0.x)
are affected. If they are, then the problem may need more research to
be understood, but given the above test results, it's likely the move
to Wheezy will automatically fix things up, so we might as well wait
a bit...
