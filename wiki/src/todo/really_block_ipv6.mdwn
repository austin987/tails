For whatever reason our firewall seems to not block all IPv6 packets,
like it should. For instance, Tails leaks link-local multicast
(ff02::1/64).

For now a simple solution to block this leak would be to disable
IPv6 altoghether, i.e. by putting:

    net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1
    net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6 = 1

in `/etc/sysctl.conf`.

> This was done in the `bugfix/disable-IPv6` branch,
> merged into devel, [[!taglink todo/done]] in Tails 0.16.

See [[todo/enable_IPv6]] for the long-term plans.
