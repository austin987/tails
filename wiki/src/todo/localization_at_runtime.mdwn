Add an Incognito-like boot menu to choose the language at runtime,
instead of building per-language images.

Implementation
==============

* use our custom *amnesiabranding* iceweasel extension to localize at runtime:
  - the homepage: done
  - the default search engine: done
* information about how many Debian localization packages fit
  on one CD:
  - 500kB for each `iceweasel-l10n-*`
  - 7MB for each `openoffice.org-l10n-*`
  - ??MB for each `openoffice.org-hyphenation-*`: many languages are
    only in >= Squeeze
  - ??MB for each `openoffice.org-thesaurus-*`: many languages are
    only in >= Squeeze
* implement a language-choosing boot menu:
  - done for i386 (ugly hack, [[!taglink todo/wait]] for live-helper
    upstream to provide a nice gfxboot-based language choosing menu)
  - [[!taglink todo/code]] a similar hack for yaboot on powerpc
  - see [[todo/boot_menu]]
* [[!taglink todo/translate]] the nautilus-wipe menu entry, in
  `chroot_local-includes/usr/local/bin/autostart-localize`
* [[!taglink todo/translate]] the desktop launchers in
  `config/chroot_local-includes/home/amnesia/Desktop/*.desktop`
* [[!taglink todo/research]] how to properly support Chinese and
  Russian languages; others? have a look to tasksel's
  chinese-s-desktop, arabic-desktop, and so on for fonts, input
  systems, etc.; also ask Christian Perrier (bubulle on IRC) for
  pointers.
* enable supported languages to be [[translated|tags/todo/translate]]
  in the wiki, once we get to reach trusted translators/reviewers; we
  don't want to ship misleading instructions.

Miscellaneous ideas
===================

* Additionally go on supporting building pre-localized images?
* Remember the chosen locale when using a writable boot device?
  (needs discussion, this breaks the "no persistence unless
  explicitly told" requirement): [[!taglink todo/discuss]]

Resources
=========

- <http://webconverger.org/i18n/> (they don't support CJK as it takes
  100M+)
- Debian Live's `live-config-staging` repository has a
  [904-locales-extra](http://live.debian.net/gitweb?p=live-config-staging.git;a=blob;f=scripts/config/904-locales-extra)
  hook that installs a locale-dependent packages set at boot-time in
  order to better support the `ja_JP`, `ko_KR` and `zh_CN` locales.
