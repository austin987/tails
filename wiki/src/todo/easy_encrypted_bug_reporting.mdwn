Add a user-friendly way to send a GnuPG-encrypted bug report to the
amnesia dev team.

Already done
============

* a small pyGTK application asking very simple questions and sending
  an encrypted e-mail to...
* a SMTP server behind a hidden service (`4mvq3pnvid3awjln.onion`),
  only allowing to relay e-mail to the dev collective address.

See WhisperBack's [gitweb](https://git-tails.immerda.ch/whisperback).

1. Properly install WhisperBack inside the system,
   using a Debian package to avoid installing build-dependencies:
   **done**.
2. make WhisperBack support checking the SSL certificate of the SMTP
   relay
   > Whisperback 1.2-beta3 is able to check any certificate if it is
   > specified as a CA in the configuration file => **done**.
3. write this fingerprint to
   `config/chroot_local-includes/etc/whisperback/config`
   > The hidden service's certificate is now included in amnesia and
   > used by the configuration file which is installed into
   > `/etc/whisperback/config.py` in the build systems => **done**.
4. test (as a WhisperBack tarball is attached to the
   wiki, it is present in generated images).
   - Whisperback 1.2-beta2 was tested and working in amnesia 0.3
   - the new Whisperback 1.2-1 deserves more testing => **done**.
5. make WhisperBack append the output of
   `/usr/local/bin/amnesia-debug` to the generated e-mail, warn the
   user about it and display a link to inspect the additional content.
   > Whisperback 1.2 uses a python configuration script where it's possible
   > to specify a callback to retrieve debugging information. The
   > configuration file installed in the built systems uses this
   > facility to achieve the same as the `amnesia-debug` command. =>
   > **done**
6. add a (localized) icon to the desktop => **done**
