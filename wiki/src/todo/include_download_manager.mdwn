[[!toc levels=2]]

Rationale
=========

As mentioned on the forum in
[[/forum/using_DownThemAll___40__iceweasle_firefox_addon__41__]], it
might be useful to include a download managar in Tails.

A usecase could be to try to download a big file across separate working
sessions.

Was discussed on tails-dev (`Message-Id:
<hDDmk9meHE6Wi1DnIw1j0UTab3VmKqKs@alan-schleuder>`), general opinion
was favorable to support the aforementioned usecase.

One should now [[!taglink todo/test]] and compare the available tools.

Options
=======

downthemall
-----------

* [[!debpkg xul-ext-downthemall]]

Test results:

* Able to recover from Internet disconnects and Tor circuit change.
* Not possible to continue a download after rebooting: it's likely
  that some state would have to be made persistent when one wants to
  use it this way. (Seems highly plausible, as the same test works
  fine on a non-persistent OS.)
* It's apparently not possible to continue a download that was stopped
  (not paused) in downthemall. Unsurprising, and a non issue.

uget
----

* [homepage](http://urlget.sourceforge.net/)
* easy-to-use download manager written in GTK+: from the package long
  description, looks a bit too feature-full.

steadyflow
----------

Simple download manager for GNOME: in Wheezy, not in Squeeze; a quick
look at the build-deps makes me think a backport is doable. Aims for
minimalism and ease of use.

multiget
--------

Graphical download manager: in Squeeze and Wheezy; from
the package long description, looks a bit too feature-full.

Rejected
--------

* kget: depends on many parts of KDE, so that's a no.
