If the system clock is off (being late), when the time is set properly from the network, the screen is blanked. As it happens during the boot process, this is a little bit sudden and frightening. Moving the mouse gets the display back, but sill, it would be best to be avoided.

As Tais does not ship `gnome-screensaver` it is probably X.org that does the blanking. One should experiment with the `-dpms` and `+dpms` options of `xset(1)`.
