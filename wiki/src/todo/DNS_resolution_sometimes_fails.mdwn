While running the 0.15 test suite, it happened that Claws Mail could
not connect to a mail server. It was clearly DNS related:  running
`host mail.example.com` also fails, but `host mail.example.com
127.0.0.2` succeeds. After the second command claws is happy due to
the DNS cache. I guess we have a serious regression from
`feature/remove-pdnsd` that only affects "DNS leaks", i.e. when the
system resolver (Tor) is used. Urgh. Oh and `tor-resolve
mail.example.com` works just fine.

**Next thing to do**: [[!taglink todo/test]] if that's still the case.

If it is, perhaps we could simply get some caching DNS resolver back
(and maybe pick unbound this time).

It seems than only non-SOCKS applications are affected.
