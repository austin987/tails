It would be nice if TrueCrypt is included in Live CD as it was in
Incognito. It has more features as Encrypted folders.

> The non-Free TrueCrypt license implies we have needed to discuss this.

Now that it has been made official that The (Amnesic) Incognito Live
System is Incognito's spiritual successor, we really have to make
a decision about this.

If we don't want to include TrueCrypt forever, we at least need to
provide a migration path from TrueCrypt to something else.

Let's include TrueCrypt for a few months/releases so that Incognito users can
get their TrueCrypt-encrypted data back.

# Implementation

[[!tag todo/pending]]

TrueCrypt installation tarball must now be shipped with T(A)ILS in
`/usr/share/amnesia`.

When `truecrypt` is specified on the kernel command-line, a `live-config`
script `203-install-truecrypt` will unpack, execute and control TrueCrypt
installer while the system boots.

# Updating TrueCrypt

TrueCrypt does not really provide a friendly way to download and verify their
installer in automatic manner.

To update the installer to a newer version:

- the tarball can be downloaded on <http://www.truecrypt.org/downloads>,
  along its PGP signature (signed by `F0D6B1E0`),
- once the signature has been verified, the tarball should be copied
  in `config/chroot_local-includes/usr/share/amnesia`.

# Future work

- Make TrueCrypt installation an option in [[boot_menu|boot menu]], once
  available.
- [[provide_a_migration_path_from_truecrypt|Provide a migration path from
  TrueCrypt]]
