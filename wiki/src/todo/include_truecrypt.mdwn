It would be nice if TrueCrypt is included in Live CD as it was in
Incognito. It has more features as Encrypted folders.

> The non-Free TrueCrypt license implies we have needed to discuss this.

Now that it has been made official that The (Amnesic) Incognito Live
System is Incognito's spiritual successor, we really have to make
a decision about this.

If we don't want to include TrueCrypt forever, we at least need to
provide a migration path from TrueCrypt to XXX:

- include TrueCrypt for a few months/releases so that Incognito users
  can get their TrueCrypt-encrypted data back; this means building
  Debian packages of TrueCrypt and some frontend software, unless this
  has already been done somewhere. [[!tag todo/code]]
- [[!taglink todo/research]], implement and possibly document
  replacement solutions.

## Standard reply to rants

Note to everyone adding her/his two cents to urge us to include
TrueCrypt: as clearly stated above, we want to do this. The
process that leads to this being done is described above. The only
thing that could speed up this process is to **help**.

About the licensing issues: being offline I can't gather the link
for you but searching the Internet for the following words should
suffice: lawyer truecrypt license redhat or fedora or gentoo.
You'll find mailing list archives explaining why Red Hat or Fedora
or Gentoo (I fail to remember) lawyers advised them not to ship
TrueCrypt. I also remember TrueCrypt license prevents anyone to
ship modified versions but I may be wrong. --intrigeri
