1. Tails makes the safe assumption that the client computer (with Windows or even just a guest computer) is full of viruses, torjan horses, remote backdoors.
2. Tails wants to boot into a secure environment without viruses, torjan horses, remote backdoors.

How does one safely get Tails?

At the moment users are implicitly told to use their insecure operating system.

Doesn't this defeat the point of Tails?

How can a compromised operating system safely download and burn Tails?

Once the operating system is backdoor infected the attacker can visually replace the Tails hash in the browser or replace the signature. The iso could also get infected after it was downloaded and checked. Direct editing for iso is difficult. Not impossible. I don't know how to do it with linux but there is a payware for windows which can (poweriso). The cd could also get infected while burning.

I don't think it's hard for some state sponsored malware to do this automatically everywhere where its installed. Does a iso infection malware toolkit already exist?

How does Tails assume users get Tails safely? By assuming no one uses iso infection?
