I think it might be a good idea if [RequestPolicy](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/requestpolicy/) was installed in Iceweasel as default.

>>> I'd also like to have RequestPolicy included, in "allow everything" mode by default. Even having it installed but disabled in about:addons would be an improvement over having to download it every time I boot up. The privacy (and speed) improvements when it's fully active are significant.

At the July dev meeting, we decided that for this to happen, this
requires:

1. someone to verify how it integrates with the browser and checks
   it's safe
2. someone who commits to maintain it in Tails on the long run
