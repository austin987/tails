Rationale: running a proprietary OS in a virtual machine *inside*
Tails would be useful by folks who cannot afford doing without their
prefered Windows-only piece of software but still want to work in a
relatively secure environment.

The compressed .deb files (4.0.x) take 20MB.

We'll soon get a [[todo/boot_menu]], support many languages and go
beyond the 700MB limit, so it may be time to implement this. (Beware:
in case it matters, we're shipping quite special guest packages that
I'm going to refresh soon to 4.1.8 --intrigeri)
