Rationale: running a proprietary OS in a virtual machine *inside*
Tails would be useful by folks who cannot afford doing without their
prefered Windows-only piece of software but still want to work in a
relatively secure environment.

The compressed .deb files (4.0.x) take 20MB.

We'll soon get a [[todo/boot_menu]], support many languages and go
beyond the 700MB limit, so it may be time to implement this. (Beware:
in case it matters, we're shipping quite special guest packages --
custom backport of the guest tools and drivers, built against the xorg
from squeeze-backports).

IIRC, VirtualBox host software sets iptables/netfilter up in a way
that makes the guest system bypass the existing firewall / or be
blocked by it, so some care should be taken on this side.

# Previous Work #
Whonix (back in times where it still was called TorBOX) implemented something very similar.

https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/wiki/OneVM/

 * Tor was running on the host = Tails in this case.
 * Some operating system was running inside the Virtual Machine.
 * iptables / bridging was used to route all VM traffic through Tor.
 * It was probable affected by identity correlation through circuit sharing.

  (Using an adaptation of this we could instruct users to set up each
  guest with Bridged Adapter on `vnet0` and then it should magically
  rout all traffic from the VM through Tor.)
