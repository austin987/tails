Plymouth stops before GDM is shown, displaying a black console with init
messages. This is only visible for a short time on a quick computer, but on
older hardware (and probably while booting on CD), it could stay several
seconds.

The first lines displayed are:

    INIT: entering runlevel 2
    Using makefile-style concurrent boot in runlevel 2

This issue looks like a bug mentioned at the end of [[!debbug
575431]], now unreproducible by the OP.

[[!taglink todo/wait]] for the migration to Wheezy + systemd,
that may magically fix such things.
