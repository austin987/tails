The current documentation for translators could be improved:

1. basic information and/or pointers about our Git branches
1. pointers to basic Git usage documentation
1. basic information and/or pointers about Gettext
1. information about what/how can be translated using transifex
   (see [TTP's doc on this topic](https://www.torproject.org/getinvolved/translation-overview.html.en))

See [Raphaël Hertzog's "Contributing to the translation of
Debian"](http://raphaelhertzog.com/2012/01/31/contributing-to-the-translation-of-debian/)
for great inspiration.
