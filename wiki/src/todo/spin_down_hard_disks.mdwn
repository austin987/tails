[Liberte Linux](http://dee.su/liberte) 

- sets the hard disks standby timeout to quite low values in order to
  save power
- enables hard disks power management features

This seems useful both for laptop users who get a better use of their
battery and for desktop users who get a more silent environment.

Implementation notes
====================

Beware: we don't want to spin down removable disks, especially the one
we booted from.

Liberte Linux now uses laptop-mode-tools instead of home-grown hdparm
commands. laptop-mode-tools does not act on USB disks so this seems
like the way to go.

See the `src/etc/laptop-mode/laptop-mode.conf` file in Liberte Linux
source tree.

> Half-done in 0.7 and 0.8, really implemented in devel branch by
> installing hdparm, shipped in 0.8.1.
