# Rationale

Partial upgrades should provide only what has changed between two
releases (deltas) and have a way to apply those changes to the
previous version. We call the file that contains this an Incremental
Upgrade Kit (IUK).

At boot-time the security warning telling that a new Tails version is available
should provide an automated way of doing the upgrade.

# Roadmap

[[!tag todo/code]]

## 1. Prerequisites

* **move to live-boot and live-config 3.x**: Tails currently ships the
  stable (2.x) branches, whereas live-boot 3.x is needed to get
  whiteouts support. This will be done as part of our work on
  [[todo/persistence]].

## 2. Infrastructure

* make it easy to **generate an Incremental Upgrade Kit** for a point release
* update **mirrors infrastructure** to support hosting Incremental Upgrade Kits

## 3. User interface

* make it easy to **install an Incremental Upgrade Kit**
* make it easy to **download an Incremental Upgrade Kit**
* update the **security warning program**, telling that a new Tails
  version is available, to run (or point at) the upgrade program if
  the new version is a point-release, and else point at full
  upgrade documentation.

## 4. Documentation

### For users

Users must be explained how to download and install an incremental
upgrade kit.

### For developers

* update **[[design documentation|contribute/design]]**
* update **[[release process|contribute/release_process]]**
* document what and how to **test** when [[preparing a Tails
  point-release|contribute/release_process/test]]

# Implementation

## Infrastructure

### generate an IUK

* think the IUK format through

Program that takes two Tails ISO images, and:

* builds the "diff" SquashFS
* gets the new kernel(s), initrd(s), bootloader configuration
* brings all this together into some kind of structured archive

## User interface

### install an IUK

Write an installer for IUKs. Some of the USB installer's code can
probably be factored out and reused.

This should not happen at the same time as normal Tails operation,
because we need to remount the boot medium read-write.

At boot time, detect if a IUK is available on the boot medium
(where?); it this is the case:

* Tell the user we're going to run the upgrade.
* Remount the boot-medium read-write.
* Extract the IUK archive.
* Move kernels and initrd's in place.
* Move bootloader configuration in place.
* Install bootloader on MBR.
* Remount the boot-medium read-only.
* Tell the user the upgrade process is finished.
* Reboot.

### security warning program

* Detects if the new version is a point-release (checking if an IUK is
  available is probably the simplest, most robust and future-proof way
  to do so)
* Points at the downloader.

### download an IUK

Write a downloader for Incremental Upgrade Kits.

* Takes two versions as arguments, downloads the IUK.
* Saves the IUK at some place where the IUK installer will find it (where?)
* Bonus points if there's an opt-in way to have the download happen in
  the clear, that is without going through the Tor network.

# Research

## Stacking squashfs images

Tails filesystem is already using `aufs` to provide a read-write filesystem on
top of the read-only `squashfs` image.

This system could probably be extended to support mounting multiple `squashfs`
filesystems on top of each others. Upgrades would be `squashfs` images with only
the files that have been modified since the previous releases. This handles file
deletions.

Shipping upgrades could be as simple as shipping those extra `squashfs` images.

Debian live supports such stacking already: see in `live-boot(7)` the
part about `/live/filesystem.module`.

Stacking squashfs images like this would still lack a way of upgrading the
kernel and the syslinux. This should also be handled by the automated upgrade
process.

### Initial test

Here is a test. First the procedure to create the *delta* squashfs image, to be
done as `root`:

    mkdir /mnt/tails-0.7.1
    mkdir /mnt/tails-0.7.2
    mount -o loop tails-i386-0.7.1.iso /mnt/tails-0.7.1
    mount -o loop tails-i386-0.7.2.iso /mnt/tails-0.7.2
    mkdir /mnt/tails-0.7.1-root
    mkdir /mnt/tails-0.7.2-root
    mount -o loop /mnt/tails-0.7.1/live/filesystem.squashfs /mnt/tails-0.7.1-root
    mount -o loop /mnt/tails-0.7.2/live/filesystem.squashfs /mnt/tails-0.7.2-root

    mkdir /mnt/upgrade-0.7.1-to-0.7.2
    mount -t tmpfs tmpfs /mnt/upgrade-0.7.1-to-0.7.2

    mkdir /mnt/union
    mount -t aufs -o br=/mnt/upgrade-0.7.1-to-0.7.2=rw:/mnt/tails-0.7.1-root=ro none /mnt/union
    rsync -avP --delete-after /mnt/tails-0.7.2-root/ /mnt/union/

    mksquashfs /mnt/upgrade-0.7.1-to-0.7.2 upgrade-0.7.1-to-0.7.2.squashfs

Compressed size (using default gzip compression) is 82 MB.

Not bad, and the new kernel is included, which can probably be avoided.

Now, let's upgrade an USB stick:

    mkdir /media/disk/live
    cp   /mnt/tails-0.7.1/live/filesystem.squashfs \
         upgrade-0.7.1-to-0.7.2.squashfs \
         /mnt/tails/0.7.2/live/vmlinuz \
         /mnt/tails/0.7.2/live/initrd.img \
       /media/disk/live

Then fiddle with GRUB or EXTLINUX.

On boot, the new squashfs gets properly integrated. *Whiteouts* are not
working. It looks like the `live-boot` 2.x mount options miss the `wh` attribute.
But wait, booting with `break=top` and modifying `/scripts/live` to replace
`roopt=rr` by `roopt=rr+wh` is enough to do the trick! Therefore,
we've added the `wh` attribute to `live-boot` 3.x.

Initial test is pretty conclusive!
