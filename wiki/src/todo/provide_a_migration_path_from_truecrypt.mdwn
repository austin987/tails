[[!meta title="Provide a migration path from TrueCrypt"]]

TrueCrypt is [[now included|todo/include_truecrypt]] in T(A)ILS, but with its
license and development practices, we would like to provide a migration
path from TrueCrypt.

Future work:

- [[!taglink todo/research]], implement and possibly document
  replacement solutions.
