Tails Greeter fails to set the correct keyboard layout for some
"Other..."  type of languages. The following languages only get the
`USA` layout, but localization otherwise seems correct (e.g. Gnome is
translated):

* Norsk bokmål (should get `Nor` (Norwegian))
* Sardinian (should get `Ita` (Italian) perhaps?)
* Hrvatski (should get `Hrv` (Croatian))
