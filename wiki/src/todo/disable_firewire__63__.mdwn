The kernel documentation reads (`debugging-via-ohci1394.txt`):

> The alternative firewire-ohci driver in drivers/firewire uses
> filtered physical DMA by default, which is more secure but not
> suitable for remote debugging. Compile the driver with
> `CONFIG_FIREWIRE_OHCI_REMOTE_DMA` [...] to get unfiltered
> physical DMA.

Given:

1. `CONFIG_FIREWIRE_OHCI_REMOTE_DMA` is not set in Debian's Linux 3.2.
1. Only the new FireWire stack (`firewire-ohci`) is shipped in
   Debian's Linux 3.2.

... Tails seems to be immune from the physical memory attacks via
FireWire/DMA we know.

>> Blacklisting + unloading `firewire_sbp2` is apparently enough to
>> make Tails immune.
