Tails's offline documentation via Yelp is slow.
This should be fixed. How?

>> Is check.torproject.org as a startpage realy required? Perhaps we can ship an offline page pointing to the documentation, and eventually to Torcheck.
>> Another workaround could be to base the offline documentation on the [[unsafe browser|todo/add_support_for_free_wifi_hotspots/]], probably shipped in the next Tails' version
