# Rationale

In general I'm worried about unauthenticated NTP. There probably
is a whole bunch of fingerprinting attacks an attacker could mount if
it could pose as the NTP server and mess with the user's time.

Also see Tails design documents about [[contribute/design/NTP]] and
[[contribute/design/HTP]].

# Authenticated NTP

As of NTPv4 the Autokey protocol has been implemented which enables
public key based authetication. According to the friendly people at
`#ntp@freenode`, a gpg like authentication scheme (i.e. get the public
key of the server, configure to use that server with that key, and
that's it) was implemented in 4.2.6 (latest stable) which fits our
needs perfectly. It remains to research exactly how that works.
Here are a few things to consider:

* We cannot use pool.ntp.org, which perhaps would be the optimal way
  to prevent fingerprinting of amnesia users. This is due to the fact
  that we need a key for each server we want, and far from all servers
  in the pool has autokey enabled. So we will have to use a fixed,
  predetermined and thus public set of servers since we need to ship
  their public keys with amnesia.

* For redundancy, more than one server need to be added. But how many?
  How much do we have to trust each server? How does the size of the
  set of servers affect fingerprinting and how does it relate to
  trust? Etc.

* We likely should contact the owners of [all autokey-enabled servers](http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Servers/ServersAuthenticatedWithAutokey)
  and ask if they want to support our cause -- we don't want to
  [[be like D-LINK](http://digg.com/hardware/Open_Letter_to_D-Link_about_their_NTP_vandalism).

* One outstanding problem is that very few open access (i.e.
  available to all) ntp servers support Autokey, and even fewer the
  particular gpg-like scheme since it require the latest stable ntp
  which has only been out since december 2009. Reasons for the low
  adoption of autokey in general might be that people don't know or
  care about it, the extra complexity of configuration, difficulty of
  setting up ways to distribute keys to the clients (which is not part
  of the protocol -- but with the new pgp like scheme this becomes
  easier for clients), and extra strain on the servers due to the
  added crypto operations needed.

=> Authenticated NTP is a long term goal for us, but not usable for
the time being. Let's (try to) use HTP in the meantime.

# Update 
> NTP autokey ... which fits our needs perfectly ...

Or not. NTP autokey does not work behind NAT.

# HTP

Our [[design document|contribute/design/HTP]] describes the
implemented solution.
