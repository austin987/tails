Rationale
=========

Current state
-------------

In current Tails,

* a root password is set in `config/chroot_local-hooks/01-password`,
  but it's public and the same on all live systems;
* full sudo access is granted to the `amnesia` user.

Problems
--------

If the user password is empty, any malware that infects user code can
get root access. Else, any malware that can guess that password (which
is particularly easy if it's written specifically for amnesia, which
is a reasonable thing to have within the threat model) while running
as the amnesia user can get root access.

One could, however, argue that protecting the root user isn't very
important given how bad a compromise of the amnesia user (which is the
most likely user account to be attacked) is: it has access to the real
IP address through /sbin/ifconfig, and everything Tor does (through
its control port) so it could send all that information to the
attacker, and we're screwed.

Sure, ifconfig will only report a local address if we're using NAT,
and a service like whatismyip.org wouldn't work due to the transparent
proxying which forwards all traffic to Tor.

A root account compromise would screw us in that case.

Obviously disabling the root account (i.e. trashing its password hash
in the shadow file) does nothing against a local root exploit.

Needed functionality
--------------------

In order to find a security/privacy/usability compromise, let's
discuss what kind of root access is needed.

### Package installation

In a Debian Live system, it's really easy to install new packages
after startup (`sudo apt-get install <package>` or through the
graphical package manager). This is a really nice and desirable
feature, making some kind of root access quite worthwhile.

OTOH, there might be an obscure Debian package whose installation
would reset our `iptables` rules. A malware could install such
a package, retrieve the real user IP, and send it to an attacker.

* A targeted piece of malware could do this with out the need of installing said software


Our plans
=========

We agreed upon using the upcoming [[todo/TailsGreeter]] 
[[todo/boot_menu]] to allow the user to type a sudo/root password in a text input
box. If none is entered, there's no root access at all. If a password
is entered, it is set for the default user + sudo enabled.

Implementation:

1. there should be no root nor user password by default;
2. the TailsGreeter should trigger a script that would run in an environnement
  containing a $TAILS_USER_PASSWORD variable
  **OR**
  the TailsGreeter should setup that env variable an the script is always run?
3. the script would set the user password, if any was given;
4. if the environnement TailsGreeter run the script in does't terminate with it,
  TailsGreeter should then unset the env variable.

The steps that are not part of the TailsGreeter (1st and 3rd) are implemented in
the branch `feature/better_root_access_control`.

Archives
========

The following solutions are kept only for historical reasons and
understanding the decision that was made.

Disabled root access by default, boot menu option to enable it
--------------------------------------------------------------

If enabled to user would be prompted to set a password during early init or initramfs.

* If [[todo/persistence]] is available it is possible to save the root line from /etc/shadow and have it automatically restored instead of showing the password setting prompt which makes this option less intrusive.
    - Since the idea of this possibility is to reduce the number of obstackes for the user during boot it wouldn't make much sense to encrypt it as the user then would have to enter the passphrase during boot instead. However, if the user has some other encrypted persistent storage (like $HOME) it could be saved there and restored after the passphrase for that container has been entered.

Mandatory password setting
--------------------------

The user is prompted for a password during init or initramfs. If an empty password is entered, the root account is disabled.

* If [[todo/persistence]] is available the password can be saved and restored as in the above solution.

Random password at boot
-----------------------

Maybe we could generate on boot a random password and display it on
screen. But that is really to bothersome in practice.


No root access, more restrictive sudo configuration
---------------------------------------------------

We could be more restrictive of which commands are allowed to run as
root.

* Enabling some commands might have dangerous consequences which are hard to anticipate.
* Some users might need less restrictions to work around bugs/problems they have -- in other words, it might be hard for us to know which commands the users expect to have available.

Root console available for 2 minutes after boot
-----------------------------------------------

This leaves the user 2 minutes to set a root password. Unless this is
done before this delay has expired, the root console is disabled, and
no root access is possible anymore (as the root account has a disabled
password by default).

This is the solution chosen by [Liberte Linux](http://dee.su/liberte).
They:

- patch inittab in `src/etc/conf.d/local.start` to run a root shell
  and have it not respawned
- set `TMOUT=120` in `src/root/.profile` (this is a bash feature that
  makes interactive terminals exit unless there is input during this
  time after the first prompt)

*Beware!* live-config patches inittab at boot time. Let's re-patch it
in a later live-config script (hint:  [[!tails_gitweb
config/chroot_local-includes/lib/live/config/]]).

Also, we don't ship the `/root/.profile` that ends up in Tails
images but we can patch it using `chroot_local-patches` after a
package has put it in place.

We also need to:

- stop setting a known root password
- set the (probably live-config) option that disables sudo for the
  default user
- write documentation (about the change / how to use it the new way)
