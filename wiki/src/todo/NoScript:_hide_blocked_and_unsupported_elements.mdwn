Quoting Andrew Lewman first-time users feedback:

> # Sixth issue: no flash, no warning
> 
> 2 of 8 people had flash apps on their website. 4 of 8 had ad banners
> that used flash. All were surprised at the red outline with a snake
> in it appearing instead of their flash apps. None understood
> what happened.
> 
> After an explanation, one person suggested changing the red outline
> with snake to an actual message written inside, along the lines of
> 'this app blocked for your protection. click here to unblock it.'
> I explained why that wouldn't work (because there is no flash, java,
> silverlight plugins installed) and their answer was 'then do not
> show it at all'. Inside noscript, I unchecked the 'show
> placeholder..' option and had them browse again. they were happy.
> It seems if the user cannot do anything about the blocked apps, not
> showing them may be preferred.
