Current state of things
=======================

Tails [[ships hybrid ISO images|contribute/design/hybrid_ISO]]. dd'ing
such a file to a USB stick produces a bootable Tails system and is
[[well documented|doc/installing_onto_a_usb_stick/linux]], but it
requires unfriendly command-line usage and overwrites any previously
existing partition table.

The current state of things implies two distasteful facts:

1. A given USB stick currently must be dedicated to Tails only;
   considering the ever-growing size of such devices, the amount of
   wasted bytes is not a minor one.
2. A given USB stick cannot be used to host both a Tails system *and*
   a persistent storage volume, which makes it hard to provide
   friendly integration of [[upcoming persistence
   features|todo/persistence]] for end-user.

Such user unfriendliness conflicts with Tails [[specified
goals|contribute/design]] and must be fixed.

Installing specification
========================

One should be able to easily install Tails to a USB storage device:

* by cloning an existing Tails system that is running from CD or USB;
* running a non-Tails operating system, from a downloaded ISO image.

The installation target may be an existing partition whose content
must be left untouched. The choice between possible destination
devices or partitions must be graphically proposed amongst the
available removable storage devices.

Moreover, at installation time, one should be allowed to setup an
encrypted storage space that can be used by the [[upcoming persistence
features|todo/persistence]]; earliest versions of the installation
program must at least leave room for it so that a later version can be
make use of it. Whether this storage space should better be a second
encrypted partition or a file-backed encrypted FS shall be researched
and decided upon. If the partition way is chosen, the installer
software must have partitioning capabilities.

* [[notes about GPT|usb_install_and_upgrade/gpt]]


Our plan is to:

1. release something useful based on the work we've already done on
   the basis of Fedora liveusb-creator
2. probably start (again...) from Ubuntu's
   [usb-creator](https://launchpad.net/usb-creator), that has a
   much saner codebase; [[usb_install_and_upgrade/future_spec]]

Our work on liveusb-creator is in a Git repository:

- anonymous, read-only: `git://webmasters.boum.org/liveusb-creator`
- developers read-write: `ssh://gitolite@webmasters.boum.org/liveusb-creator.git`

Integration work is made in the `feature/usb_installer` branch in the
main Tails Git repository.

### Overview

Unfortunately, no single existing piece of software satisfies the
above specification. It seems like everyone writes their own USB
installer; after the following round-up has been made, this is no
surprise at all: since such tools are designed to be dead easy for the
non-technical end-user, every author selects the few features that are
the most important ones for their intended audience, and generally
writes a very ad-hoc piece of software. Therefore, every Live system
project whose needs are slightly different from the others needs to
write its own USB installer, possibly reinventing more or less wheels
along the road.

We need to see if we can turn one of those tools into something that
satisfies our specification; sadly, proceeding this way *without
forking the existing tool* would probably need more initial
development time than writing a new installer from scratch; we are not
even sure any upstream author of such a software (good enough to be a
possible viable basis) would want to make it more generic and maintain
it this way; on the other hand, if we avoid forking or writing from
scratch, we also avoid maintaining a Tails-specific tool on the long
run.

### Existing tools

[[!tag todo/test]]

Wikipedia has a [[!wikipedia List of tools to create Live USB systems]]
we should look at.

* `live-installer` udeb and its `live-installer-launcher` desktop
  companion allows to run the Debian Installer from the bootloader;
  paraphrasing the manual: the "Live" Debian Installer flavour will
  proceed in an identical fashion to the normal installation but at
  the actual package installation stage, instead of using
  `debootstrap` to fetch and install packages, the "live" filesystem
  image is copied to the target. After this stage, the Debian
  Installer continues as normal, installing and configuring items such
  as bootloaders and local users, etc. This must be tested.

  > Not usable without a lot of work: there is way too many
  > questions asked, the graphical interface overlaps the
  > panels (hence unreachable buttons), it tries to create
  > a new user account, etc. Forget it, even if it was nice
  > to have partman handy to configure partitions and
  > bootloaders.

* `live-boot`'s `todisk=DEVICE` boot parameter could be used to copy
  the entire read-only media to the specified device; the process
  could then be:

  1. boot from CD
  2. use some documentation or GUI to partition the USB stick and take
     note of its device name
  3. reboot; at syslinux prompt add the `todisk=DEVICE` parameter
     using the previously noted device name; then let the system boot
     once from the USB stick, and use some documentation or GUI to
     install a bootloader on the USB stick. This step might be
     automated in live-boot.
  4. reboot and eject the CD: the system should now boot from USB.

  This only works for the "clone existing system" usecase, though.

Booting methods
---------------

### Overview

Tails [[ships hybrid ISO images|contribute/design/hybrid_ISO]]. dd'ing
such a file to a USB stick produces a bootable Tails system but it
overwrites any previously existing partition table. This method is
therefore not suitable for us since it does not satisfy the
"non-destructive upgrade process" requirement.

Two alternatives booting methods have been investigated:

1. **Boot ISO file**: Setup a bootloader on the USB stick that is able
   to boot an ISO image dropped into the right directory of it. Even
   early boot files (kernel, initramfs) are loaded from *inside* the
   ISO file. The bootloader installed on the USB stick can either
   directly boot the kernel from inside the ISO file or chainload the
   ISO image's bootloader. In the first case, until the
   [[todo/boot_menu]] task is completed, the installed boot loader
   must present a boot menu that at least allows the user to choose
   her preferred language.

2. **Copy ISO's content**: Copy needed files (mainly the kernel,
   initramfs and SquashFS image that live in the `live/` directory)
   from the ISO filesystem to the destination partition, then setup a
   bootloader that uses files in that directory. The end result is
   more or less equivalent to dd'ing the ISO image to the USB stick,
   but achieved with a non-destructive process.

### Grub2

#### Grub2's loopback support

Debian Live now supports Grub2 and `fromiso=`. The grub.cfg that is
generated inside the binary image could be copied, adapted and used to
(loopback) boot an ISO dropped on a USB stick.

Here is how to test this.

0. Build a Debian Live iso or iso-hybrid image with a working
   `live-boot` installed in it, i.e. at least 2.0.12 (warning: Tails
   0.6 series ship a buggy version).
1. Create a ext2 filesystem on a USB stick partition.
2. Copy a Tails ISO file **at the root** of the USB stick partition.
3. Run `ln -s . boot` at the root of the (mounted) USB stick partition.
4. Install Grub2 on the USB stick MBR, using the USB stick partition
   as `--root-directory`.
5. Create a `grub.cfg` file in there and try a menu entry like this:

          menuentry 'test' --class debian --class gnu-linux --class gnu --class os {
                insmod part_msdos
                insmod ext2
                insmod loopback
                insmod iso9660
                set root='(hd0,msdos1)'
                search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set b51975cd-c5ef-4b32-996a-2c8206516917
                loopback loop /binary.iso
                linux   (loop)/live/vmlinuz boot=live fromiso=/dev/sda1/binary.iso config
                initrd  (loop)/live/initrd.img
          }

Details:

* `insmod ext2` is because the partition that hosts Grub2 and the ISO
  is a ext2 one
* `(hd0,msdos1)` and the search UUID match this partition as well,
  from Grub2 point-of-view
* `/dev/sda1` is a path to this partition block device from inside the
  Live initrd
* `/binary.iso` is the path to the ISO file, relative to the root of
  the partition
* `/live/vmlinuz1` and `/live/initrd1.img` are respectively the path
  to the kernel and ramdisk relative to the root of the ISO filesystem
* `boot=live` enables `live-boot` and thus `fromiso=`
* `config` enables `live-config`

This might fails at kernel load time with following error:

    error: invalid magic number

In that case you probably need a newer Grub2 (see [[!debbug 543924]]
for details).

**Warning!**

1. On some versions of Tails, this breaks the [[emergency
   shutdown|contribute/design/memory_erasure]] on media removal.
2. This is by no means a supported installation method. E.g. the
   kernel parameters shall be manually updated when replacing the ISO
   with a newer one.

#### Security matters

In the above example, the Grub2 configuration file must contain
information about the partition where the ISO file is stored.

Doing this is feasible at install time, and ensures the ISO will be
loaded from the right partition, rather than from a rogue one on the
host system's hard-disk.

Other Live systems that don't face the same threat model as Tails tend
to prefer using automagic ISO loopback support so that Grub2 itself
finds a partition where a properly named ISO is stored, e.g. using
[GRML's patches against
live-boot](http://git.grml.org/?p=live-boot-grml.git;a=tree;f=debian/patches)
that add the `findiso=` boot parameter (by the way, does it respect
`live-media=removable` ?); here is how they boot things up:

- GRML (`grml-rescueboot` flavor) [now supports booting using Grub2
  loopback](http://michael-prokop.at/blog/2011/01/07/booting-iso-images-from-within-grub2/)
- comments of
  http://blog.cyphermox.net/2010/10/booting-to-iso-images-from-usb-key.html
- Super Grub Disk's
  [loopback.cfg](http://www.supergrubdisk.org/wiki/Loopback.cfg) might
  be [going
  upstream](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/grub-devel/2010-09/msg00080.html).

#### Grub2 combined with syslinux' memdisk

This is used by some in combination with Grub2, in place of its
loopback support. The [memdisk
page](http://syslinux.zytor.com/wiki/index.php/MEMDISK) on the
syslinux wiki tells the whole low-level story and more.

Resources:

- GRML (`grub-imageboot` flavor) [now supports booting using
  Grub2+memdisk](http://michael-prokop.at/blog/2011/01/07/booting-iso-images-from-within-grub2/);
  according to this blog post, support for doing this is in live-boot
  2.0.14-1. The memdiskfind/phram/mtdblock approach this blog post
  talks of would ease cloning an existing Tails system, since it is
  supposed to provide a `/dev/mtdblock0` device, which should be the
  .ISO image. See the [details on the memdisk wiki
  page](http://syslinux.zytor.com/wiki/index.php/MEMDISK#-_memdiskfind_in_combination_with_phram_and_mtdblock).
- a [blog
  post](http://blog.snow-crash.org/2010/11/cool-things-with-grub2-and-syslinux---booting-floppy-and-iso-images.html)
  with a snippet for `grub.d` to automate booting ISO images from
  Grub2, using syslinux' memdisk

### extlinux and memdisk

According to Philip Hands, who proposed this solution on [[!debbug
534887]], it is possible to use extlinux merely to chainload the
image's own bootloader.

Partitioning
------------

Various scripts, such as [Benjamin FOURTICQ's
one](http://www.mail-archive.com/debian-live@lists.debian.org/msg01832.html),
aim at adding a persistent home-rw partition to a Debian Live disk
image, generally using losetup and parted. They don't suit Tails
specification as they depend on knowing in advance the size of the
persistent volume the user wants to setup and obviously cannot setup
encryption on it in place of the user.

On the other hand,
[udisks](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/udisks) provides a
D-Bus interface that makes it easy to programmatically partition a
storage device and create filesystems in there without messing with
low-level details; its LUKS encryption support probably is the killer
feature that makes it the perfect library for the job.

Upgrade
=======

One should also be able to easily and non-destructively upgrade a
given Tails system installed on a USB storage device.
Non-destructively means not touching any partition or file other than
the ones managed by the Tails installation system. Proceeding this way
is needed to make it possible using a single USB stick for the Tails
system *and* some persistent storage space.
The upgrade issue is actually twofold: network burden and writing the upgraded
live system on the USB stick.

Full upgrade
------------

Full upgrades happen between major releases, eg. 0.7 and 0.8.

Full upgrades should look as much as possible as a new installs. So it should be
possible to do it from any platform supported by the USB installer.

As for installing, people should be able to provide the ISO to the installer or
ask the installer to download it.

From inside Tails it should also provide an opt-in option to download the full
ISO outside Tor.

Once the upgrade is finished the old ISO is removed automatically from the USB
stick.

Partial upgrade
---------------

Partial upgrades only happen between minor releases, eg. 0.7 and 0.7.1.

Partial upgrades should provide only what has changed between two releases
(deltas) and have a way to apply those changes to the previous version.

At boot-time the security warning telling that a new Tails version is available
should provide an automated way of doing the upgrade.

### Stacking `squashfs` images

Tails filesystem is already using `aufs` to provide a read-write filesystem on
top of the read-only `squashfs` image.

This system could probably be extended to support mounting multiple `squashfs`
filesystems on top of each others. Upgrades would be `squashfs` images with only
the files that have been modified since the previous releases. This handles file
deletions.

Shipping upgrades could be as simple as shipping those extra `squashfs` images.

Actually there seems to be such an option in Debian live already, see in `man
live-boot` the part about `/live/filesystem.module`. There is need to do [[!taglink
todo/research]] on this.

Stacking squashfs images like this would still lack a way of upgrading the
kernel and the syslinux. This should also be handled by the automated upgrade
process.

### A test

Here is a test. First the procedure to create the *delta* squashfs image, to be
done as `root`:

    mkdir /mnt/tails-0.7.1
    mkdir /mnt/tails-0.7.2
    mount -o loop tails-i386-0.7.1.iso /mnt/tails-0.7.1
    mount -o loop tails-i386-0.7.2.iso /mnt/tails-0.7.2
    mkdir /mnt/tails-0.7.1-root
    mkdir /mnt/tails-0.7.2-root
    mount -o loop /mnt/tails-0.7.1/live/filesystem.squashfs /mnt/tails-0.7.1-root
    mount -o loop /mnt/tails-0.7.2/live/filesystem.squashfs /mnt/tails-0.7.2-root

    mkdir /mnt/upgrade-0.7.1-to-0.7.2
    mount -t tmpfs tmpfs /mnt/upgrade-0.7.1-to-0.7.2

    mkdir /mnt/union
    mount -t aufs -o br=/mnt/upgrade-0.7.1-to-0.7.2=rw:/mnt/tails-0.7.1-root=ro none /mnt/union
    rsync -avP --delete-after /mnt/tails-0.7.2-root/ /mnt/union/

    mksquashfs /mnt/upgrade-0.7.1-to-0.7.2 upgrade-0.7.1-to-0.7.2.squashfs

Compressed size (using default gzip compression) is 82 MB.

Not bad, and the new kernel is included, which can probably be avoided.

Now, let's upgrade an USB stick:

    mkdir /media/disk/live
    cp   /mnt/tails-0.7.1/live/filesystem.squashfs \
         upgrade-0.7.1-to-0.7.2.squashfs \
         /mnt/tails/0.7.2/live/vmlinuz \
         /mnt/tails/0.7.2/live/initrd.img \
       /media/disk/live

Then fiddle with GRUB or EXTLINUX.

On boot, the new squashfs gets properly integrated. But *whiteouts* are not
working. It looks like the `live-boot` 2.x mount options miss the `wh` attribute.
But wait, booting with `break=top` and modifying `/scripts/live` to replace
`roopt=rr` by `roopt=rr+wh` is enough to do the trick! Therefore,
we've added the `wh` attribute to `live-boot` 3.x.

Initial test is pretty conclusive!

### Appending to `squashfs` image (discarded option)

`mksquashfs` can actually append new files to an existing `squashfs` image.

Initial images are created with files in a specific order to
[[improve boot time on cd]], but on a USB stick random access is a non-issue.

[[!taglink todo/test]] if `mksquashfs` can append an image that is currently
used without weakening a running system.

Upgrading the system would result in a series of files to be appended to the
current `squashfs` image.

This option had been discared because it is not possible to remove files.

### Deltas (discarded option)

A possible way to encode deltas for the two previous methods could be:

 * For each file that has been modified: a binary delta and a new set of
   metadata if they have changed.
 * A list of deleted files.

And `mksquashfs` would be used in the running live system after applying the
delta to create a `squashfs` image with the upgrade.

But there is probably things that have been left out of such an early draft.

### Binary diff (discarded option)

Plain `diff` does not work on binary files.

Binary diffs ([rsync], [xdelta], [bsdiff], [VCDIFF]) gives poor
result on live system images because `squashfs` images vary
strongly as a whole, even for tiny changes of the files inside.
That situation is unlikely to change ([[!debbug 602965]]) and is even worse
with `squashfs-lzma`. Quoting `xz` manpage:

     Compressed output may vary
       The exact compressed output produced from the same uncompressed input
       file may vary between XZ Utils  versions  even if  compression  options
       are identical.  This is because the encoder can be improved (faster or
       better compression) without affecting the file format.  The output can
       vary even between different builds of the same XZ Utils  version, if
       different build options are used.

       The  above means that implementing --rsyncable to create rsyncable .xz
       files is not going to happen without freezing a part of the encoder
       implementation, which can then be used with --rsyncable.
