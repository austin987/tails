Allow easily installing T(A)ILS to a USB storage device

* from a running (CD or USB) amnesia system
* from another OS, using a downloaded ISO image

[[!toc levels=2]]

specification
=============

* allow creating an encrypted persistence storage space (e.g. a second
  encrypted partition, or a file-backed encrypted FS) or *at least*
  leave room for it
* allow non-destructively upgrading the live system only, not touching
  the other partitions (use the iso + grub trick ? tar image
  + cp?)

booting methods
---------------

### syslinux hybrid image

Since 0.5 every T(A)ILS ISO image we ship now is a persistent one:

- it can be burnt to a CD;
- it also contains a full disk image (including partition table) and
  can thus be copied (using `dd`) to a USB stick; the USB stick's
  content is lost in the operation.

Successful tests:

* boot the resulting `test.iso` as a normal optical drive in
  VirtualBox
* boot the resulting `test.iso` as a KVM hard disk
* convert the resulting `test.iso`, posing as a HDD image, into the
  native VirtualBox disk format, using `VBoxManage
  convertfromraw -format VDI test.iso test.vdi`, then boot the
  resulting `test.vdi` disk image in VirtualBox
* `dd` the hybrid `test.iso` to a USB stick and boot it on
  a USB-boot-enabled computer.

Notes:

* the partition number may need to be 4, in order to be compatible
  with the BIOSes supporting only USB-Zip;
  [reference](http://syslinux.zytor.com/archives/2009-May/012380.html)
* the partition type may need to be `1c`, i.e. hidden FAT32 LBA;
  [reference](http://syslinux.zytor.com/archives/2009-May/012384.html)
* boot failures were experimented when testing without the `-entry
  4 -type 1c` options.

Conclusion: this is a nice way to get bootable USB images for almost
free.

### misc

* apart when using a setup able to boot an ISO image, one needs to
  copy the ISO's `live/` directory to the destination partition, and
  setup a bootloader there
* use grml's
  [patches to live-initramfs](http://git.grml.org/?p=live-initramfs-grml.git;a=tree;f=debian/patches) 
  to support directly booting an ISO image... merged in upstream Git,
  commit 6458a8862db68. Another of their patches (namely
  `07_support_findiso.dpatch`) adds support for the
  `findiso` boot parameter, which is needed for easy usage; this one
  has not been applied upstream yet; does it respect the
  `live-media=removable` boot parameter?
* Philip Hands' solution proposed on [[!debbug 534887]]
  uses extlinux chainloading the image's own bootloader

### Grub2

#### fromiso and loopback

Debian Live now supports Grub2 and `fromiso=`. The grub.cfg that is
generated inside the binary image could be copied, adapted and used to
(loopback) boot an ISO dropped on a USB stick.

Here is how to test this.

0. Build a Debian Live iso or iso-hybrid image with a working
   `live-boot` installed in it, i.e. at least 2.0.12 (warning: T(A)ILS
   0.6 has a buggy one).
1. Create a ext2 filesystem on a USB stick partition.
2. Copy a T(A)ILS ISO file **at the root** of the USB stick partition.
3. Run `ln -s . boot` at the root of the (mounted) USB stick partition.
4. Install Grub2 on the USB stick MBR, using the USB stick partition
   as `--root-directory`.
5. Create a `grub.cfg` file in there and try a menu entry like this:

	menuentry 'test' --class debian --class gnu-linux --class gnu --class os {
	        insmod part_msdos
	        insmod ext2
	        insmod loopback
	        insmod iso9660
	        set root='(hd0,msdos1)'
	        search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set b51975cd-c5ef-4b32-996a-2c8206516917
	        loopback loop /binary.iso
	        linux   (loop)/live/vmlinuz1 boot=live fromiso=/dev/sda1/binary.iso config
	        initrd  (loop)/live/initrd1.img
	}

Details:

* `insmod ext2` is because the partition that hosts Grub2 and the ISO
  is a ext2 one
* `(hd0,msdos1)` and the search UUID match this partition as well,
  from Grub2 point-of-view
* `/dev/sda1` is a path to this partition block device from inside the
  Live initrd
* `/binary.iso` is the path to the ISO file, relative to the root of
  the partition
* `/live/vmlinuz1` and `/live/initrd1.img` are respectively the path
  to the kernel and ramdisk relative to the root of the ISO filesystem
* `boot=live` enables `live-boot` and thus `fromiso=`
* `config` enables `live-config`

This might fails at kernel load time with following error:

    error: invalid magic number

In that case you probably need a newer Grub2 (see [[!debbug 543924]]
for details).

#### automagic ISO loopback support

- GRML [now supports booting using Grub2 loopback](http://michael-prokop.at/blog/2011/01/07/booting-iso-images-from-within-grub2/)
- comments of
  http://blog.cyphermox.net/2010/10/booting-to-iso-images-from-usb-key.html
- Super Grub Disk's
  [loopback.cfg](http://www.supergrubdisk.org/wiki/Loopback.cfg) might be
  [going upstream](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/grub-devel/2010-09/msg00080.html)

### syslinux' memdisk

[[!tag todo/research]]

This is similar to grub2's fromiso and should be investigated.

Resources:

- GRML [now supports booting using
  Grub2+memdisk](http://michael-prokop.at/blog/2011/01/07/booting-iso-images-from-within-grub2/);
  according to this blog post, support for doing this is in live-boot >=2.0.14-1.
- the [memdisk page](http://syslinux.zytor.com/wiki/index.php/MEMDISK)
  on the syslinux wiki
- a [blog
  post](http://blog.snow-crash.org/2010/11/cool-things-with-grub2-and-syslinux---booting-floppy-and-iso-images.html)
  with a snippet for `grub.d` to automate booting ISO images from
  Grub2, using syslinux' memdisk

frontend UI
-----------

(Testing all these is probably [[!taglink todo/easy]].)

Wikipedia has a [[!wikipedia List of tools to create Live USB systems]]
we should look at.

* `live-installer` udeb and its `live-installer-launcher` desktop
  companion allows to run the Debian Installer from the bootloader;
  paraphrasing the manual: the "Live" Debian Installer flavour will
  proceed in an identical fashion to the normal installation but at
  the actual package installation stage, instead of using
  `debootstrap` to fetch and install packages, the "live" filesystem
  image is copied to the target. After this stage, the Debian
  Installer continues as normal, installing and configuring items such
  as bootloaders and local users, etc. This must be tested.

> Not usable without a lot of work: there is way too many
> questions asked, the graphical interface overlaps the
> panels (hence unreachable buttons), it tries to create
> a new user account, etc. Forget it, even if it was nice
> to have partman handy to configure partitions and
> bootloaders.

* `live-boot`'s `todisk=DEVICE` boot parameter could be used to copy
  the entire read-only media to the specified device; the process
  could then be:
  1. boot from CD
  2. use some documentation or GUI to partition the USB stick and take
     note of its device name
  3. reboot; at syslinux prompt add the `todisk=DEVICE` parameter
     using the previously noted device name; then let the system boot
     once from the USB stick, and use some documentation or GUI to
     install a bootloader on the USB stick. This step might be
     automated in live-boot.
  4. reboot and eject the CD: the system should now boot from USB.
* Incognito's `root_overlay/usr/sbin/create-usb` seems quite nice, as
  it allows using an existing fat32 partition, but it does not
  proposes to partition the USB device first. Their own
  [TODO](https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/incognito/trunk/TODO)
  contains some nice ideas about the current topic.
* Liberté Linux' `burn-usb` creates a FAT32 partition for data and
  an ext2 partition where it copies the system to. It installs Grub on
  the USB stick.
* Ubuntu's [usb-creator](FIXME)
   - supposed to replicate exactly the CD to USB
   - does not seem to recognize non-Ubuntu CDs (0.1.16 crashes on
     Lenny, 0.1.10 does not display them in the GUI even if it the
     console output proves that it takes good note of their presence )
   - how does it handle partitions?
   - [launchpad](https://launchpad.net/usb-creator)
* [UNetbootin](http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/)
   - works on Windows and GNU/Linux
   - has a plugin architecture that only allows rebranding and
     pre-selection of the available distributions list
   - included in squeeze and sid, easily backported to Lenny
   - works like a charm to install an ISO image to USB, but the
     syslinux menu has the unetbootin logo instead of Debian's one
   - non-destructive install: does not format the chosen partition
   - works from a running Live CD; specify /dev/cdrom as ISO diskimage
   - **TRY ME**: .img image to USB?
* [Ubuntu LiveUSB](http://klik.atekon.de/liveusb/)
   - (a bit too) simplistic
   - dedicated to "create a bootable Live USB medium from a running
     Ubuntu Live CD"
   - depending on sources, it partitions USB stick with one single
     800MB partition or one partition using the whole device; in any
     case, it unconditionally overwrites the device's content
   - able to upgrade without re-partitioning the device?
   - [launchpad](https://launchpad.net/liveusb)
* aptosid's `aptosid-on-a-stick` needs an input ISO (check again), and
  lacks partitioning capabilities, but it still deserves being looked
  at more thoroughly; see the
  [manual](http://manual.aptosid.com/en/hd-install-opts-en.htm#usb-hd).
* Fedora's `livecd-iso-to-disk`:
   - [manual](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FedoraLiveCD/USBHowTo)
   - [Gitweb](http://git.fedorahosted.org/git/?p=livecd)
   - cleanly and defensively written in Bash
   - supports creating a file-backed filesystem for `$HOME`,
     LUKS-encrypted by default, in the same partition where the Live
     system is installed
   - uses parted
* Fedora's [liveusb-creator](https://fedorahosted.org/liveusb-creator/):
   - works on Windows and GNU/Linux
   - "non-destructive install", which means?
   - supports FAT and EXT filesystems
   - persistent storage creation: file-backed filesystem, lacks
     partitioning capabilities
   - actively developed (as of early 2011)
   - written in Python
   - input: ISO file or real CD
   - output: extracts ISO's content to the partition
   - does not use `livecd-iso-to-disk`
   - needs to be slightly adapted/extended to support non-Fedora Live
     systems, e.g. some directory names must be made configurable
   - sidux ships a modified version:
     which does not work on Lenny due to `dosfslabel` exiting with
     error code 1 even when successful
      - [.deb](http://sidux.office-vienna.at/sidux/debian/pool/main/l/liveusb-creator/),
      - [source](http://w3you.com/liveusb-creator/liveusb-creator.htm)
* Moblin's [Image
  Writer](http://git.moblin.org/cgit.cgi/moblin-image-creator/plain/image-writer)
   - written in Python
   - simple dd wrapper with proper sanity checks
* [Mandriva Seed](http://git.mandriva.com/?p=projects/mandriva-seed.git;a=summary)
   - supports Windows and GNU/Linux
   - fork of Fedora's liveusb-creator
* [RIP’s mkusb](http://rip.7bf.de/current/mkusb.sh) and its
  [README](http://rip.7bf.de/current/mkusb.txt)
* [usb-imagewriter](https://launchpad.net/usb-imagewriter)
   - seems like a clone of the good old rawwrite with no more feature
     at all
* SUSE Studio Image Writer([[!wikipedia SUSE Studio ImageWriter]],
  [KIWI homepage](http://kiwi.berlios.de/), [source
  code](http://git.berlios.de/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=kiwi;a=tree;f=tools/burner))
   - supports Windows and GNU/Linux
   - persistent storage creation, that is?
* <http://wubi-installer.org/>: Windows installer for Ubuntu. Really relevant?
* [makebootfat](http://advancemame.sourceforge.net/boot-readme.html):
  command line utility able to create bootable USB disks
  using the FAT filesystem and syslinux
   - available in Debian
   - able to autodetect/partition/format/populate the USB disk in a
     single step without any user interaction
   - able to create disk images which are compatible with all the
     three standards USB-FDD, USB-HDD and USB-ZIP at the same time
   - could be used to do most of the low-level work
* [FUSBi](http://aligunduz.org/FUSBi/)
   - modified from UNetbootin
   - supports Windows and GNU/Linux
   - no release in 2009 nor 2010
