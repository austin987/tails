Rationale
=========

In addition to [[ship Vidalia instead of TorK]], we need to find and
install a great non-KDE virtual keyboard in order to stop installing
KDE libraries.

Previous research was unsuccessful, but things may have changed in
the meantime.

Initial research
================

kvkbd
-----

* automagically guesses the (localized) keyboard layout from the
  current X config
* needs KDE libs

[onBoard](http://launchpad.net/onboard)
-------

* shipped by Ubuntu
* keyboard layout dynamic learning bug reports:
  [65626](https://bugs.launchpad.net/onboard/+bug/65626),
  [391997](https://bugs.launchpad.net/onboard/+bug/391997)
* there is a notification area icon
* depends on the Python gconf bindings, that are available in Squeeze
  (package `python-gconf`) and in Lenny (package `python-gnome2`)

[matchbox-keyboard](http://matchbox-project.org/?p=1)
-----------------

* packaged for lenny
* misses a gnome panel applet/notification area icon, but it shouldn't be a lot to write, as there is one for matchbox panel provided
* here is a french layout : [[keyboard-fr.xml]]

gok
---

* was not able to get it working

xvbkd
-----

* no dynamic layout loading
* quite ugly

Caribou

Implementation
==============

onBoard seems to be the nicest available solution.

Custom package
--------------

[[!tag todo/done]]

Have custom built packages included in amnesia:

1. rebuild `python-virtkey` packages for our supported architectures
   (no extra work needed), and drop the debs into
   `config/chroot-localpackages` **done**
2. adapt the onBoard source package for Lenny **done**
3. build an onBoard package (arch-independent) and drop it into
   `config/chroot-localpackages` **done**
4. publish the modifications we made to the Ubuntu source package **done**
 * 0.93.0-0ubuntu3~~amnesia1:
   [[.diff.gz|onboard_0.93.0-0ubuntu3~~amnesia1.diff.gz]] and
   [[.dsc|onboard_0.93.0-0ubuntu3~~amnesia1.dsc]]
 * 0.92.0-0ubuntu4~~amnesia1:
   [[.diff.gz|onboard_0.92.0-0ubuntu4~~amnesia1.diff.gz]] and
   [[.dsc|onboard_0.92.0-0ubuntu4~~amnesia1.dsc]]
5. add an autostart file **done**
6. test! **done**
7. stop installing kvkbd **done**

Long-term goal: inclusion in Debian
-----------------------------------

[[!tag todo/code]]

1. file RFP bugs for `python-virtkey` and `onboard`
2. wait for these packages to reach Squeeze
3. ask for Lenny backports
4. remove our custom packages from `config/chroot-localpackages`, add
   these packages names to
   `config/chroot_local-packageslists/tails-common.list` and add suitable
   APT pining
