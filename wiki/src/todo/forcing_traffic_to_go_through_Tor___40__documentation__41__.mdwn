If you are going to create documenation, could you please specify how you enforce the traffic to go through Tor and what its limits are? I can communicate with my local router via UDP with
dig @192.168.1.1 example.com
I understand that normal programs would figure out that pdnsd 127.0.0.1:53 is the resolver (/etc/resolv.conf), but I am not sure what your policies on using LAN are.
