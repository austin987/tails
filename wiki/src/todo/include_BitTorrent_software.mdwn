On the one hand, Jake asks us to include a BitTorrent client. On the
other hand, other members of the Tor project point users to [a blog
post of
theirs](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/bittorrent-over-tor-isnt-good-idea)
that explains why *Bittorrent over Tor isn't a good idea*. Tails is
probably a special case that could make it not totally unsafe, but
we're not there yet, it seems.

Next things to do
=================

Waiting for
-----------

[[!tag todo/wait]]

1. An answer from other members of the Tor project about it:
   <https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2011-December/022550.html>
2. Jacob audits Transmission, or picks an adequate alternative and
   audits it.

Research
--------

Once what we're waiting for is done:

1. research how to use [[todo/separate_Tor_streams]] can be used to make it
   safe(r) to use BitTorrent over Tor (see [the aforementioned blog
   post](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/bittorrent-over-tor-isnt-good-idea)
   for hints)

Unsorted
--------
