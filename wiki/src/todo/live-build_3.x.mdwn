Some improvements, such as
[[todo/save_more_disk_space_at_build_time]], can only be done after we
switch to live-build 3.x.

Next things to do:

* update the `feature/live-build-3.x` Git branch
* build the `feature/live-build-3.x` Git branch
* see what breaks, report bugs upstream and possibly fix them.
