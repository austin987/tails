Some improvements, such as
[[todo/save_more_disk_space_at_build_time]], can only be done after we
switch to live-build 3.x.

Next things to do:

* update the `feature/live-build-3.x` Git branch
  - live-build 3.0~a56-1 removes `chroot_local-patches`
* build the `feature/live-build-3.x` Git branch
* see what breaks, report bugs upstream and possibly fix them.

Benefit from more live-build 3.x improvements:

* inject variables through `config/environment.binary` into the binary
  environment
* use `--firmware-chroot true` instead of manually listing all
  firmware packages
