Implementation
==============

When the persistence feature is enabled **and** no persistence media
is found locally, the user would be asked for a server address +
login, password + encryption passphrase. Possible remote storage
include:

 - IMAP
 - sftp
 - [Syncany](http://www.syncany.org/) (similar to Dropbox, but data is
   encrypted locally) supports many storage types, including IMAP
 - tahoe-lafs?
 - [DIBS](http://web.mit.edu/~emin/www/source_code/dibs/index.html) : Distributed Internet Backup System
+  data encryption
+  distributed
+  but command line only
+  and not maintaned anymore ( [last update 2009-11-23](http://sourceforge.net/projects/dibs/) )

- Is there a Fuse IMAP filesystem? Other ways to fetch a given email?

> duplicity, an encrypted backup solution has an IMAP backend since
> version 5.0.7 (6.x is available in lenny-backports and squeeze). It is
> able to backup and restore from a folder available in an email
> account. One downside: it uses Python's imaplib which does know
> how to connect to IMAP server with SSL or StartTLS, but not how
> to verify X.509 certificates.

- Encryption: symmetric GnuPG, encfs, ecryptfs, file-backed LUKS or
  dm-crypt?
