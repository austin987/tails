TorK is a good Tor controller but:

 * it is based on KDE 3.X which requires many extra libraries,
 * it is not directly supported by the Tor project.

=> let's ship Vidalia instead.

The necessary debconf preseeding and `$HOME` configuration are
already in amnesia's source tree.

Vidalia is now [in Debian](http://packages.debian.org/vidalia) which
only leaves proper integration to be done. The 0.1.15-1 package from
Squeeze is easily backported for Lenny, and could be uploaded to
backports.org.

[[!tag todo/done]] using a custom package:

- [[.dsc|ship_Vidalia_instead_of_TorK/vidalia_0.2.7-1~lenny+amnesia1.dsc]],
  [[.debian.tar.gz|ship_Vidalia_instead_of_TorK/vidalia_0.2.7-1~lenny+amnesia1.debian.tar.gz]] and
  [[.orig.tar.gz|ship_Vidalia_instead_of_TorK/vidalia_0.2.7.orig.tar.gz]]
- [[.dsc|ship_Vidalia_instead_of_TorK/vidalia_0.2.6-1~~amnesia1.dsc]],
  [[.debian.tar.gz|ship_Vidalia_instead_of_TorK/vidalia_0.2.6-1~~amnesia1.debian.tar.gz]] and
  [[.orig.tar.gz|ship_Vidalia_instead_of_TorK/vidalia_0.2.6.orig.tar.gz]]

Some UI elements that are useless in the context of amnesia are not
shown in this version.

In order to remove KDE libraries, we also have to
[[install a non-KDE virtual keyboard]]. **done**
