The solution we decided to fix FTP in Iceweasel is to use FoxyProxy
with:

* a regexp filter `ftp://.*` so FTP gets direct connections (or is
  proxied through an FTP proxy).
* a regexp filter `http(s)?://.*` for proxying HTTP(s) through polipo.
* the rest goes to Tor via socks.

(Note that Torbutton does not (AFAICT) interfere as FoxyProxy always
takes precedence to the proxy settings in Torbutton.)

This solutions opens up for some interesting possibilities if we want
to add i2p to amnesia. Then we could add the regexp filter
`http://[a-zA-Z0-9\.]*\.i2p(/.*)?` for i2p eepsites (which are like
Tor's .onion:s but using the .i2p TLD) so they are proxied through
i2p. This has been tried while running i2p in amnesia, and all seems
to work perfectly.

> The I2P part is implemented in the devel branch; see the [[design
> document|contribute/design/I2P]] for details.

>> Alternatively, GNOME's FTP support shall be tested. If it works,
>> maybe we want to move this task to wishlist. [[!tag todo/test]]
