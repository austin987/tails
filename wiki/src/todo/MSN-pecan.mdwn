As proposed on the forum, see [[forum/No_MSN_-_no_alternative__63__]], we could
consider including msn-pecan as an alternative pidgin plugin to provide a MSN.

It's in debian since squeeze, seems to support SSL, is under active development,
etc.

See [[https://code.google.com/p/msn-pecan/]].

It somehow seems more secure than the "normal" Pidgin's MSN support in
that no [CVE](https://cve.mitre.org/) was ever created against it.
It may be due to lower popularity, less tests and reviews, but it's
not that clear since msn-pecan supports Pidgin, Adium, telepathy-haze,
and Nokia N900.

Early September 2011: the popcon reports approx. 180 users,
the PTS ([[!debpts msn-pecan]]) reports a still unpackaged 3-months
old new upstream version, the BTS reports no bug.

The current Debian Squeeze version (0.1.1-1) is completely broken due
to protocol changes ([upstream bug
299](https://code.google.com/p/msn-pecan/issues/detail?id=299),
[[!debbug 624733]]). A backported 0.1.2-1 works nicely => let's ship
that.

> Done in devel branch, qa time.

>> We're told that one cannot connect to MSN servers using Tails 0.10.1.

>>> After tesing MSN-pecon on Tails .11 rc1, the only way that I could get it to work was by running 'torify pidgin' in the terminal.  Tor SOCKS proxy enabled in the MSN account settings did not work for me.

**Next things to do:**

* test msn-pecan on latest Tails. [[!tag todo/qa]]
* [[!taglink todo/test]] msn-pecan on regular Wheezy.
