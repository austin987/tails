1. download a file on the Desktop with iceweasel
1. the file name is not displayed on the Desktop
1. open the Desktop folder in Nautilus
1. the file name is not displayed in the Desktop folder
1. click the Nautilus refresh button
1. the file name appears, finally, both in the folder and on the

Why does this happen? Next things to do:

* [[!taglink todo/test]] and check if it can be reproduced in
  a non-Live Squeeze GNOME installation
* [[!taglink todo/test]] and check if it can be reproduced in
  a standard Debian Live Squeeze GNOME

> It seems to be fixed in Tails 0.17.  
> Can anyone confirm, then close ?
