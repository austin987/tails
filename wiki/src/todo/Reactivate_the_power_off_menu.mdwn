The power off menu is desactivated since Tails 0.9.

Now, when the red button in the top-right corner is pushed, the computer is automatically turned off, without confirmation.

- This can happen accidently (this button is really close to the 'close this window' button). Then all the data not saved are lost.

- It's not possible anymore to reboot, or lock the screen.

It's perhaps possible to reactivate this menu, and move this button just on the left for an emergency shutdown
