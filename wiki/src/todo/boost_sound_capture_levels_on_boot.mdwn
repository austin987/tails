Now that randomsound is [[installed|install_randomsound]], we should:

* boost the sound capture levels to make randomsound more effective;
* disable capture sources monitoring to prevent such captured sound to
  be part of playback.

These steps must happen quite early on boot, ideally before Tor
is started.

The installed `alsa-utils` package provides:

* the `amixer` program to do the real work;
* most of the base code to work nicely in most environments: in the
  `/etc/init.d/alsa-utils` initscript.

> We have replaced randomsound with haveged, so this is not needed
