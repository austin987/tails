The [[security/IP_address_leak_with_icedove]] can be fixed by setting
mail.smtpserver.default.hello_argument to "localhost". See [this Tor
wiki
entry](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/TheOnionRouter/TorifyHOWTO/EMail#ExperimentalSuggestionsforpossiblymakingthunderbirdandorclawsstopleakinginfoExperimental)
for other goodies. By applying those configurations I think both claws
and icedove comes to an equal level security-wise.

The question is, though, why we would want to migrate back to Icedove
from claws.

[[!toc levels=2]]

Rationale
=========

Pros
----

* Icedove has a *much* easier guide for setting up an email account -- just enter a name, email address and password, and Icedove will check if the domain of it has IMAP (preferred) or POP, and SMPT, and set up an account correctly and automatically, beginning with trying SSL/STARTTLS so no login credentials are unnecessarily leaked. claws is pretty much impossible to setup for normal people, but seeding the config could make that easier, but will it be as easy?
* Enigmail has a *much* easier guide for generating a key and setting up GnuPG. The guide starts pretty much automatically and is very informative.
* Icedove is more widely used, so it's less fingerprintable and perhaps familiar to more users. This (and its larger development team) also likely results in earlier bug fixes.

Cons
----

* It will be somewhat harder to implement the [[todo/easy_MUA_configuration]] with Icedove compared to claws. That would allow us some flexibility for our use case, e.g. specific recommendations w.r.t. anonymity.
* Icedove's automatic account creation process will fallback to plaintext POP/IMAP/SMTP if SSL/STARTTLS fails. That could result in leaks of login/password in many circumstances, like if the user types the wrong domain in the email address. I can't seem to find any options to disallow plaintext, although mail.smtp.ssl=2 (must use SSL) seems interesting (haven't found anything for POP/IMAP though).
* Icedove requires an additional ~20 MB uncompressed space over claws.
* Icedove probably has more bugs given its code size.

I think implementing the [[todo/easy_MUA_configuration]] is pretty far from trivial, at least if we want it to be as easy as Icedove's account creation guide, which brings that whole idea into question. Maybe a better approach would be to write an addon for Icedove that alters the account creation process (if that is possible -- I have no insight in how much addons can do)? It'd give the user some use case specific information, e.g. to not use a non-anonymous email account, and also implement the other ideas from [[todo/easy_MUA_configuration]]. And it would disallow plaintext plaintext POP/IMAP/SMTP.

Design decisions
================

* Trying to hide we use Icedove seem unrealistic and/or impractical
  a goal, at least to start with. Therefore, we'll ignore tagnaq's
  suggestions whose single aim is that one. E.g. we won't encourage
  people to use PGP-inline.

* Our Iceweasel says it prefers English. It does not try to pretend it
  has no locale. Our Icedove shall do the same. So we will keep
  `mailnews.reply_header_authorwrote` default value (that is, `%s
  wrote` and will ignore tagnaq's suggestion on this; details: [doc on
    reply_header_](http://kb.mozillazine.org/Reply_header_settings)

Things to implement
===================

[[!tag todo/code]]

Spoof User-Agent
----------------

1. pretend to be Thunderbird
2. pretend to be running on the same OS as Firefox Torbutton does
3. pretend to be the Thunderbird version that was current when the
   Firefox version advertised by Torbutton itself was

Things to be checked / researched
=================================

[[!tag todo/research]]

* how is Icedove's "autoconfiguration file" fetched? (authenticated
  SSL? any information leak?) -> it's ugly:
  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=664633
* general privacy/anonymity issues: [tagnaq's
  paper](http://bit.ly/qDZm7C)

found answers
-------------

* how well are Enigmail, Icedove and l10n packages maintained in
  Debian? -> seems acceptable - I've seen much worse times, especially
  for this set of packages.
* how much size does Icedove + Enigmail + l10n packages add to the
  SquashFS compared to Claws Mail? -> *9MB* (as of Tails pre-0.8 devel
  branch with XZ SquashFS compression)

Notes from the latest discussion
--------------------------------

Thunderbird 5.0 improves the autoconfig: at least now it is possible to stop it,
see <http://kb.mozillazine.org/Thunderbird_5.0_-_New_Features_and_Changes#Account_setup>.

We could ask Tor to block all plain text port (23, 110, 143) but that would
prevent the use of StartTLS.

For the moment, we propose instead to try (not spending too much time on it) to
code some patches on their upstream version. One option could be to disable the
steps of the autoconfig wizard corresponding to cleartext. Let us
[[!tag todo/research]] what exactly we want to patch to make the
autoconfig sane.
