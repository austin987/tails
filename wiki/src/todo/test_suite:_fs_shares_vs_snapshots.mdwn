Filesystem shares cannot (due to QEMU limitations) be added to an
active VM, and cannot (due to QEMU limitations) be active
(i.e. mounted) during a snapshot save. Hence unmounting before save
and remounting after restore them seems like a good idea.

However, the `9p*` modules seem to get into a broken state during a
save + restore (the "tags" used as `mount` source cannot be found), so
unloading before save and reload after restore comes to mind. But
loading `9pnet_virtio` fails after a restore with `probe of virtio2
failed with error -2` (in `dmesg`) and the shares remain unmountable.

We should research this further, and determine
whether we're just doing something wrong, or if this is an upstream
bug.
