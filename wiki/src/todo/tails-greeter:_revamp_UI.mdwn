Rationale
=========

 * tails-greeter exists and works (quite) fine
 * its code in not that bad anymore: now feasible to add features
 * its UI is difficult to use

We have to find a way to have an ergonomic UI.

Proposals
=========

Stop discouraging work on tails-greeter, bring positive input first
-------------------------------------------------------------------

People who have strong opinions on how t-g should work or should not,
please write this ASAP on the dedicated [thread on
tails-dev](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2012-October/001781.html).

Random ideas
------------

Some options should be probably setup differently. Typically like the language
one which already has a todo item.
[[todo/allow_choosing_language_at_installation_time]]

Clarify our specs and revisit past decisions
--------------------------------------------

e.g.

 * do we still want the first screen to look like a Windows (NT4) login screen?
 * do we still want a second screen for options? Or another way to show it?

Make an usability study?
------------------------

 * Draft several User eXperience (and layout) options
 * Make them testable
 * Make an usability study:
   - catch testers (Tails users and/or newbies)
   - make them test, see what they do and ask them what they think

We may want to ask input from UX experts, and/or pay one to run the usability
study.

Try something easier
--------------------

Drafting a new possible version first could be useful, and then we can decide
wether we want to ship it right away, or create other options and benchmark
them through a full-blown usability study

It's still possible to make a branch on the TailsGreeter repo and begin to
implement a proposal:

 * ask for ideas on tails-dev ML
 * propose 1 or 2 implementations
 * make "them" test and see what happens
   (other people may be able and willing to have such prototypes tested
   by first-time users, and might have himself interesting feedbacks).

The ones who draft new t-g UI may want to
have a look at gnome's studies on the subject (pages on <http://live.gnome.org>).

Pending questions
-----------------

* Do we want the look to depend on wether the Windows theme was opted-in?
* How much do we want to optimize for first-time users?

Roadmap
=======

0. [[Think about our plans for Wheezy|todo/tails-greeter vs. Wheezy]]
0. Do the "try something easier" way (Note: a developper commited to
   lots of thinks in that plan, but not to any deadline (not
   priority)!)
   0. ask for ideas: **done**
   0. propose one or several prototypes: **done**
   0. **Next thing to do**: make some testing happen [[!tag todo/test]]
   0. extract something useful from the result
   0. implements the choosen proposal
0. If we get funding that for and it's still necessary, do the usability study

Prototypes
==========

Some proposals to test!

## Goals

My goals for the interface was:

- read in "natural" order: top to bottom
- no hidden windows/options
- easy to adapt to right-to-left languages RTL
- inspired/similar to GNOME3 "system preferences"

## Screenshots

Please test the script below, which lets you try the user experience!

The greeter started from DVD:

[[!img greeter.png align="right" size="" alt=""]]

The greeter started from USB with persistence:

[[!img greeter+persistence.png align="right" size="" alt=""]]

The greeter started from USB with persistence once language selected:

[[!img greeter+persistence+kbd.png align="right" size="" alt=""]]

The greeter once the administration password option clicked:

[[!img greeter-opt-adm.png align="right" size="" alt=""]]

The greeter once the keyboard option clicked:

[[!img greeter-opt-locale.png align="right" size="" alt=""]]

The greeter once the windows camouflage option clicked:

[[!img greeter-opt-persistence.png align="right" size="" alt=""]]

## How to test

Download everything in [[tails-greeter: revamp UI/mockups]], or better clone the git, go to the
directory and:

    $ ./mockup.py [-v <variant>] [-p]

Dependencies: gtk3, python gobject introspection (basically debian wheezy)

## Questions

I'd like to hear about:

- your overall impression?
- should keyboard selectable independently from locale in one click?
- your navigation experience?
- where should the locales box be?

(Note that some answers were sent on tails-dev already.)

## Remarks (add yours!)

- add a symbol if option was visited/activated
- activation of presets in persistence: when?

Existing work

Reports
=======

Report #1
---------

User interface is confusing.

The combination of "green/red icons + the check mark + pushed button" is
really hard to grasp.

How about a big push button labeled "Persistence", maybe with an icon?

The current behaviour for "More options?" is also problematic… How about
having a "More options" button at the bottom, near the "Login" button?
Ideally, this would require a "Back" button on the "Administration
password" scren, but even without it, I think the result will be easier
to understand/use.

Report #2
---------

A few impressions after the publication of the screenshots. Great job
by the way!

The buttons ON/OFF are sometime confusing, as it's hard to know if it
reflects the actual configuration, or the ability to modify this
configuration, i.e. if the option is *actually* activated or if
clicking on this button will toggle this option ON. I hope I'm clear
enough :)

Please also keep in mind that some use small screens, and can get
blocked if the cannot see the validation button.

Last point, as I will have to use Tails-greeter *at each boot*,
I would like to be able to handle it easily with the keyboard, to save
a lot of time.

That said, thanks a lot for the great job!

Report #3
---------

Indeed, this is a great polishing of the user interface, at least in
terms of appearance. I failed to download anything from the mockups
page though so be aware that this opinion is based on the screenshots
only

I do have some corrections and suggestions though, from the screenshot
it is apparent that it allows to choose "Portugués" as
a region/locale, which is not! It is a river and neighborhood in Porto
Rico. "Português" is the correct word for Portuguese in Portuguese.

Now as for if "Should keyboard selectable independently from locale in
one click?", I would say yes as I use it in the current greeter. I do
this for two reason: First in case my tails session gets owned the
attacker will perhaps not know from which country I am though I am
aware in that situation I probably have far worse problems as far as
de-anonimization goes. And second, I am fluent in English, and
I prefer to see the menus and the documentation in English (as are
more complete). Having to scroll down to get the Portugal keyboard in
the current greeter is quite annoying though and I often wonder why
are the other languages more obscure keyboards (like without dead keys
and etc) before the more default options. Perhaps ordering
alphabetically by languages and after all the defaults keyboards then
again the lesser keyboards in this new greeter? (btw why is Portuguese
absent from the locales screenshots?)

A last, but most important imho suggestion: no matter how ergonomic
you can make the greeter it will always have some usability problems,
but there is a way to minimize this! There is already a todo ticket
for choosing language at installation time ( see:
https://tails.boum.org/todo/allow_choosing_language_at_installation_time/ )
but then if someone got hold of your tails she/he could see from where
you are and what language you speak. Now, if a new feature in the
greeter was implemented - "Greeter Password" (pass-phrase would be
overkill in this case as usability is preferred) - language, locale,
but also camouflage, read only options for persistence, keyboards and
other options to come in the greeter, could be defined at installation
time and accessed at boot time with a few keystrokes from universal
keys in keyboards. Or perhaps you have two greeter configurations and
could setup two passwords.. If you think this feature could be useful
perhaps you could revamp the greeter with this in mind for a future
version? ;)

Okay that's its :) the overall opinion of the greeter from the
screenshots is that you made an amazing job :-) congratulations and
thanks :-)
