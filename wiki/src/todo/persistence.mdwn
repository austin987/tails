Data persistence is a somewhat tricky topic in a Live system context,
especially one explicitely designed to avoid leaving any trace of
its use.

Some real-life usecases however require to setup some kind of
data persistence, which should then be carefully introduced
and supported.

Usecases
========

[[!tag todo/research]]

What could be made persistent?
------------------------------

It remains to determine which usecases are of interest for our users
and thus should be support. Here are some possible ones.

### User data

#### Persistent application-specific configurations

This might be relevant for the following applications:

- gpg/ssh/vpn/OTR keys/configurations
- certificates
- IM and MUA configurations (since these can take a several
  steps to setup which is annoying to redo for every amnesia
  session)
- I2P data/cache/log directory (/var/lib/i2p)

Perhaps it would be possible to make a tool so that the user can
choose exactly what files/directories that should be persistent,
and when to update them? Whith such a general solution the above
things would not have to be implemented individually and could
be present as default suggestions in the tool.

#### Persistent user data store

A persistent non-home data store for whatever random files the user
wants to have persistent.

#### Full /home persistence

All of /home is persistent. This is very convenient for users who
have complex configurations for certain applications, like IMs,
MUAs, gpg an the like.

On the other hand clueless users could do really bad configurations that would
persist and thus expose them even after a reboot.

Also T(A)ILS upgrades to configurations in $HOME would be pretty
difficult to apply without breaking the users own configuration.

Great care should be given to the potential leaks of web browser
cache and history, IM logs and similar applications and their
data, so that even if the /home is compromised, it should be
difficult for the attacker to tell what exact internet resources
and services have been used. Unless the user has explicitly
chosen to store such information (bookmarking a site, adding
someone to their contact list or address book, activated IM chat
logs etc.).

### System

#### Persistent application installations

If a user need some program
not present in amnesia per default it can be quite annoying to fetch
the apt information (which takes a lot of time over tor) and
download it (also slow), it could be nice to have a persistent
directory (or similar) where all .deb-files are installed during
init.

#### System wide persistence

This would give users fine-grained control of the system and
possibility to set it up exactly after their own expectations.

All the problems of a persistent /home applies but are amplified
to a system-wide scale, for instance

- users can also fuck up the firewall configuration
- sensitive information may leak outside of /home, like to
  /tmp, /var/log etc.
- get a persistent virus or other malware
- T(A)ILS upgrades would be near-impossible without breaking stuff.

Persistence storage location
----------------------------

* Encrypted partition on a removable storage device.
* Encrypted archive file on a removable storage device.
* Use persistence without a persistence media: an encrypted persistent
  archive could be remotely stored on existing storage services e.g.
  via IMAP or sftp. When the persistence feature is enabled **and** no
  persistence media is found locally, the user would be asked for a
  server address + login + password + encryption passphrase.

Specifications
==============

Once a persistent volume is enabled, two operation modes should be
supported:

* read-write access: changes to persistent files are saved
* read-only access to **only** be able to *use* persistent files
  (e.g. a GnuPG keyring) without leaving any new trace.

Moreover:

* T(A)ILS should default to use a persistent store it can detect on
  removable media *in read-only mode*.
* Read-write access to a persistent data store must not be the
  default: it must require a voluntary user action such as choosing
  enabling a "with read-write persistent data" option in the boot
  menu.
* The persistent data must be stored using strong, well-known, Free
  Software, peer-reviewed encryption tools.
* Blacklist fixed storage devices from the search for persistent
  volumes? Preventing the risk of using a malicious persistent volume
  seems more important than supporting the rare "I want to store my
  persistent volume on a fixed hard-disk" use-case.
  - grml's patch against `live-initramfs` to optionally set all
    harddisk devices to read-only mode was applied upstream as
    `97846cf1b1a`; this option should probably be forcibly enabled
    when the users chooses to activate some kind of persistency from
    the boot menu.

Roadmap
=======

The first use cases that will be supported are:

* persistent application-specific configurations;
* persistent user data store.

Implementation
==============

Debian Live already supports several kinds of persistence, including
snapshots of selected files and persistence store automounting, both
at the `$HOME` and system-wide levels.

Encryption of the persistent volumes is supported using cryptsetup or
loop-aes.

Persistent application-specific configurations
----------------------------------------------

Neither home automounting nor `live-snapshot` currently fit the
application-specific configuration persistence use case. Both because
they are not finely grained enough and persist too much. The best path
to a usable implementation seems to improve `live-snapshot`; it seems
like a better starting point because it has an include list feature
(`/etc/live-snapshot.list`) and is kinder to USB sticks (think of
write wearing); what needs to be done (checked in live-boot 2.0~a16-1
due to working offline with an outdated Git working copy):

- When booting from USB, `/dev/sda` is mounted instead of `/dev/sda1`.
  This prevents creating a second partition (even when the second
  partition is created outside of T(A)ILS?).
- Add support for file deletion (e.g. by replacing cpio with rsync).
- Add a read-only mode.
- There is no way to enable the home-sn kind of persistence while
  disabling others. We could either implement a simple whitelist-only
  `persistent-types=TYPE1,TYPE2,...` boot parameter or a full-featured
  whitelist+blacklist boot parameters set such as the one used in
  live-config (`live-config=`, `live-noconfig=`).
- Add a way to ignore internal hard disks when looking for persistence
  data.
- `live-snapshot` needs to be run as root; make it able to run with
  slightly less permissions (e.g. use sudo only when needed, or simply
  manage to run as a non-priviledged user for such kind of partial
  `$HOME` persistency.
- The persistence data search order is not well documented enough:
  live-sn and home-sn files are searched before accordingly labelled
  partitions.
- The `persistent=cryptsetup` boot parameter is undocumented. Moreover
  it is incompatible with `persistent=nofiles` which involves snapshot
  files are first searched on non-encrypted devices, then on encrypted
  ones. It probably should be made into a first-class independent
  parameter such as `persistent-encryption=cryptsetup`.
  `persistent-encryption=luks` would btw. be more correct and would
  allow adding support for plain dm-crypt mappings that are also setup
  with cryptsetup.
- The cryptsetup support is not able to deal with file-backed Luks
  snapshots. Do we need this? On the long run we would probably prefer
  supporting plain dm-crypt mappings hidden in files: something
  similar to the `live-media-offset` would be perfect; the UI side of
  it will be tricky if we want to ask the offset to the user; this
  could happen either in the boot menu or by hooking a menu
  that would probably run from inside the initramfs, before
  `scripts/live` attempts to copy snapshots data.
- The `do_snap_copy` sub-procedure calculates free memory but does not
  seem to check there is actually enough.

Full /home persistence
----------------------

The "home automounting" flavor seems like a nice starting point to
implement full /home persistency but it needs to be extended a bit:

* support a read-only mode (e.g. using aufs or similar), e.g.
  using a "persistent-ro" boot parameter
* support enabling `$HOME` persistence while disabling full
  persistence

Both seem easy to implement and contribute to the upstream
`live-boot` (everything happens in `scripts/live`).

Remote persistence storage
--------------------------

- Is there a Fuse IMAP filesystem? Other ways to fetch a given email?

- Encryption: symmetric GnuPG, encfs, ecryptfs, file-backed Luks or
  dm-crypt?

Read-only mode
--------------

There are two main ways to support using a persistent store in
read-only mode:

* copy the persistent content at boot time to a filesystem location (aufs)
* merge the persistent volume with a "diff" branch on ramdisk using
  aufs, and mount the resultant device, so that the mountpoint is seen
  as writable by applications but no actual change is made on disk.

User interface
--------------

### at boot time

Choosing between various persistence modes calls for a more complex
(implementation-wise) boot menu. See the thread on tails-dev about a
graphical boot menu for details.

### during runtime
