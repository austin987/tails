Data persistence is a somewhat tricky topic in a Live system context,
especially one explicitely designed to avoid leaving any trace of
its use.

Some real-life usecases however require to setup some kind of
data persistence, which should then be carefully introduced
and supported.

Usecases
========

It remains to determine which usecases are of interest for our users
and thus should be support. Some possible ones are:

* All of /home is persistent. This is very convenient for users who
  have complex configurations for certain applications, like IMs,
  MUAs, gpg an the like.
  - Clueless users could do really bad configurations that would
    persist and thus expose them even after a reboot.
  - amnesia upgrades to configurations in $HOME would be pretty
    difficult to apply without breaking the users own configuration.
  - Great care should be given to the potential leaks of web browser
    cache and history, IM logs and similar applications and their
    data, so that even if the /home is compromised, it should be
    difficult for the attacker to tell what exact internet resources
    and services have been used. Unless the user has explicitly
    chosen to store such information (bookmarking a site, adding
    someone to their contact list or address book, activated IM chat
    logs etc.).
* System wide persistence. This would give users fine-grained control
  of the system and possibility to set it up exactly after their own
  expectations.
  - All the problems of a persistent /home applies but are amplified
    to a system-wide scale, for instance
      - users can also fuck up the firewall configuration
      - sensitive information may leak outside of /home, like to
        /tmp, /var/log etc.
      - get a persistent virus or other malware
  - amnesia upgrades would be near-impossible without breaking
    stuff.
* A persistent non-home data store for whatever random files the user
  wants to have persistent.
* Persistent application installations. If a user need some program
  not present in amnesia per default it can be quite annoying to fetch
  the apt information (which takes a lot of time over tor) and
  download it (also slow), it could be nice to have a persistent
  directory (or similar) where all .deb-files are installed during
  init.
* Persistent application specific configurations.
  - This might be relevant for the following applications:
      - gpg/ssh/vpn/OTR keys/configurations
      - certificates
      - IM and MUA configurations (since these can take a several
        steps to setup which is annoying to redo for every amnesia
        session)
  - Perhaps it would be possible to make a tool so that the user can
    choose exactly what files/directories that should be persistent,
    and when to update them? Whith such a general solution the above
    things would not have to be implemented individually and could
    be present as default suggestions in the tool.

Specification bits
==================

Once a persistent volume is enabled, two operation modes should be
supported:

* with read-write access in order to be allowed to update persistent
  files
* with read-only access to **only** be able to *use* persistent files
  (e.g. a GnuPG keyring) without leaving any new trace; the
  (read-only) persistency store must be merged with a "diff" branch on
  ramdisk using aufs, so that the mountpoint is seen as writable by
  applications

Moreover:

* The persistent data must be stored using strong, well-known, Free
  Software, peer-reviewed encryption tools.
* Read-write access to a persistent data store must never be the
  default, and must require a voluntary user action, such as choosing
  "with read-write persistent data" non-default item in the boot menu.
* Blacklist fixed storage devices from the search for persistent
  volumes? Preventing the risk of using a malicious persistent volume
  seems more important than supporting the rare "I want to store my
  persistent volume on a fixed hard-disk" use-case.
  - grml's patch against `live-initramfs` to optionally set all
    harddisk devices to read-only mode was applied upstream as
    `97846cf1b1a`; this option should probably be forcibly enabled
    when the users chooses to activate some kind of persistency from
    the boot menu.

Implementation
==============

Debian Live already supports
[several kinds of persistence](http://live.debian.net/manual/html/persistence.html).

The "home automounting" flavor seems like a nice starting point to
implement full /home persistency but it needs to be extended a bit:

* support a read-only mode (e.g. using aufs or similar), e.g.
  using a "persistent-ro" boot parameter
* support enabling `$HOME` persistence while disabling full
  persistence

Both seem easy to implement and contribute to the upstream
`live-boot` (everything happens in `scripts/live`).

cryptsetup-encryption of the persistent volumes has been supported
since
[commit 5d38c26a3480357730c4913d298a1a6318a7b08c](http://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/debian-live-changes/2008-February/002320.html)
to `live-initramfs`.

Persistence features are supposed to be rewritten in `live-initramfs`
2.x (i.e `live-boot`), see the "RFC: live-initramfs 2.x features"
thread on the [debian-live
mailing-list](http://lists.debian.org/debian-live/).

Neither home automounting nor `live-snapshot` currently fit the
application-specific configuration persistence use case. Both because
they are not finely grained enough and persist too much. The best path
to a usable implementation seems to improve `live-snapshot`; it seems
like a better starting point because it has an include list feature
(`/etc/live-snapshot.list`) and is kinder to USB sticks (think of
write wearing); what needs to be done:

- add support for file deletion (e.g. by replacing cpio with rsync)
- add a read-only mode
- is encryption supported? if not, implement it.
- is there a way to enable only this kind of persistence while
  disabling full /home and full system persistence? if not, implement
  it.
- `live-snapshot` needs to be run as root; make it able to run with
  slightly less permissions (e.g. use sudo only when needed, or simply
  manage to run as a non-priviledged user for such kind of partial
  `$HOME` persistency.
