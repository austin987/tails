Any included networked application needs to be analyzed for possible
information leakages at the protocol level, e.g. if IRC clients leak
local time through CTCP, if email clients leak the _real_ IP address
through the EHLO/HELO request etc.

This could be limited to applications whose protocol allows for
such leakages.


# General issues

The "[[bugs/claws_with_torsocks_leaks_hostname]]" bug was fixed, but
the fact that `torsocks` behaves worse than `tsocks` in this respect
is worrying and should be investigated further. Perhaps other
applications using `torify` are also affected?
