[[!meta title="Debian package build infrastructure"]]

It should be possible to work e.g. on our iceweasel and icedove custom
packages without needing a über-powerful system at `$HOME`.

[[!debpts debomatic]] was setup on the `debomatic.lizard` VM.

Next things to do:

* [[!taglink todo/test]] the support for squeeze-backports (brought
  by the latest snapshot package we've installed)
* [[!taglink todo/test]] building a big package
* move the [[!taglink todo/documentation]] to [[contribute]]
* make it so the pbuilder chroots are updated on a regular basis
  [[!tag todo/sysadmin]]
