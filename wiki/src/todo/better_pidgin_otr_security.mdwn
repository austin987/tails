We need to only allow OTR protocol v2 and later, to circumvent the
protocol version negotiation attack described in [Finite-State
Security Analysis of OTR Version
2](http://www.jbonneau.com/OTR_analysis.pdf) ... until the protocol +
libotr themselves are fixed.

This is fixed in 4.0.0 beta 1.

We need to [[!taglink todo/wait]] for a newer version to land in
Debian, but in the meantime, we want to
[[todo/disable_protocol_downgrade_in_pidgin-otr]].
