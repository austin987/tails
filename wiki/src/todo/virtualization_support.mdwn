## amnesia as a VirtualBox guest

Backported VirtualBox 3.0 guest utilities, X11 drivers and kernel
modules are installed inside amnesia.

What works:

* the option to integrate the guest windows inside a X11 desktop
* kernel modules are loaded at runtime
* X11 auto-detects the VirtualBox video and input drivers
* sharing folders between a GNU/Linux host and an amnesia guest
* mouse integration

Iff we [[decide|discussion]] to support the "amnesia as a guest inside
Windows" usecase, we’ll need to test:

* desktop integration inside Windows;
* filesharing between an amnesia guest and a Windows host.

## amnesia as a VMware guest

Seems to work fine inside VMWare Player 3, using the ISO as the
guest's CD-ROM, with the 'Debian 5' Guest OS preset.

warn users when running inside a VM
===================================

Tell users, when running inside a VM, that they are implicitly
trusting both the VM software *and* the host OS. This is needed to
avoid creating a false sense of security, which is often quite worse
as no security and a clear sense of it.

This warning could be implemented using the desktop notification
system (like our existing security flaw notification), triggered by
a script that detects the best it can if amnesia is running on real
hardware or inside some kind of VM.

Special cases:

* when running inside a non-free VM, suggest that the user switches to
  VirtualBox or some other free software VM
* when running inside a VM within a non-free host OS, emphasize the
  pseudo-security situation.

### imvirt

* [homepage](http://micky.ibh.net/~liske/imvirt.html)
* [Perl module](http://packages.debian.org/libimvirt-perl) and
  [executable](http://packages.debian.org/imvirt) are packaged in
  Squeeze; the Perl module should work as-is on Lenny

### virt-what

* [homepage](http://people.redhat.com/~rjones/virt-what/)
* [packaged in Debian](http://packages.qa.debian.org/v/virt-what.html)
* seems easy to backport to Lenny

### Sys::Detect::Virtualization

Dave O'Neill has a [compiled detection
tricks](http://www.dmo.ca/blog/detecting-virtualization-on-linux/),
based on which he has written the [Sys::Detect::Virtualization Perl
module](http://search.cpan.org/~doneill/Sys-Detect-Virtualization/).
This module is not in Debian, but should be easy enough to package
thanks to `dh-make-perl`.

### misc tricks

* VMware: open-vm-tools has an app called vmware-checkvm that does exactly this
* VirtualBox: see `in_virtual_machine` function in Debian's `virtualbox-ose-guest-utils` init script
* KVM:
 - with virtio enabled: check PCI devices whose vendor is
   `1af4:` (i.e. Qumranet, Inc.)
 - without virtio: [[!taglink todo/research]]; check PCI devices whose
   subsystem vendor contains `1af4`:

	lspci -vmm -n | grep '^Svendor' | awk '{print $2}' | grep 1af4

* qemu: [[!taglink todo/research]]; same as KVM?

The `autorun4linuxCD` offers a graphical tool to reboot on the
inserted Live CD or to boot it inside qemu.
