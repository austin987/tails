Status
======

The [[design document dedicated to virtualization
support|contribute/design/virtualization_support]] contains notes
about the already working bits in this field.

## Tails as a VirtualBox guest

The VirtualBox 4.x guest utilities, X11 drivers and kernel modules are
installed inside Tails.

What works:

* the option to integrate the guest windows inside a X11 desktop
* kernel modules are loaded at runtime
* X11 auto-detects the VirtualBox video and input drivers
* sharing folders between a GNU/Linux host and a Tails guest
* mouse integration

[[!tag todo/test todo/easy]]
Since we want to support the "Tails as a guest inside Windows"
usecase, we need to test:

* desktop integration inside Windows
 - Win7 SP1, VirtualBox 4.0.4 r70112: mouse integration works
   flawlessly
* filesharing between a Tails guest and a Windows host

## Tails as a VMware guest

Seems to work fine inside VMWare Player 3, using the ISO as the
guest's CD-ROM, with the 'Debian 5' Guest OS preset.

Warn users when running inside a VM
===================================

Most of the work [[has been done|contribute/design/virtualization_support]].

Left to do:

* when running inside a non-free VM, suggest that the user switches to
  VirtualBox or some other free software VM: [[!taglink todo/code todo/easy]];
* when running inside a VM within a non-free host OS, emphasize the
  pseudo-security situation; [[!taglink todo/research]] how to detect
  when the host OS is non-free; seems almost impossible :/

Resources
=========

QEMU for Windows
----------------

It's hard to find proper information about this online.
QEMU's website leads us to a broken link.

It seems the source code can be found
[here](http://www.h7.dion.ne.jp/~qemu-win/index.html) and pre-compiled
binaries [elsewhere](http://homepage3.nifty.com/takeda-toshiya/). This
is the place Incognito fetched its QEMU for Windows copy from.

The only piece of information I was able to find to reproduce such
binaries from source is the
[patchset](http://www.h7.dion.ne.jp/~qemu-win/download/qemu-0.9.0-patches.zip)
linked from the aforementioned page.

I could find no license information either.

autorun4linuxCD
---------------

The `autorun4linuxCD` offers a graphical tool to reboot on the
inserted Live CD or to boot it inside qemu. The Debian package seems
dedicated to Debian Live: [[!taglink todo/test todo/easy]]

* [homepage](http://www.klabs.be/~fpiat/projects/autorun4linuxCD/)
* Debian package: [[!debpts autorun4linuxcd]]
* `git clone git://git.debian.org/git/debian-live/autorun4linuxcd.git`

It seems the package should be installed on the build system, and the
content of `/usr/lib/autorun4linuxcd/` copied at build time to the
binary root of the built image.

Also, qemu for Windows should be installed in the binary image.

Incognito
---------

Incognito installs qemu for Windows at build time (`livecd-stage2.sh`).

win32-loader
------------

Supported by live-build in `scripts/build/lb_binary_win32-loader`,
packaged in Debian.

Portable VirtualBox
-------------------

Shipping a Portable VirtualBox could be a nice alternative to QEMU.

[Linux Live USB Creator](http://www.linuxliveusb.com/) includes a
Portable VirtualBox copy. This project is licensed under GPL v3,
[source code](http://old.linuxliveusb.com/en/about/sources.html) is
available as well as a
[launcher](http://svn.tuxfamily.org/viewvc.cgi/lilicreator_dev/trunk/vbox-launcher/).
This one seems worth being tested. [[!tag todo/test]]

There is also [another version](http://www.vbox.me/) but I could find
no license information nor source code. Moreover it seems it provides
no support for a pre-configured launcher, but rather [runs the
VirtualBox configuration
wizard](http://maketecheasier.com/install-virtualbox-in-usb/2010/01/02).
