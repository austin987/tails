## T(A)ILS as a VirtualBox guest

Backported VirtualBox 3.0 guest utilities, X11 drivers and kernel
modules are installed inside amnesia.

What works:

* the option to integrate the guest windows inside a X11 desktop
* kernel modules are loaded at runtime
* X11 auto-detects the VirtualBox video and input drivers
* sharing folders between a GNU/Linux host and an amnesia guest
* mouse integration

Iff we [[decide|discussion]] to support the "amnesia as a guest inside
Windows" usecase, we’ll need to test:

* desktop integration inside Windows;
* filesharing between an amnesia guest and a Windows host.

## T(A)ILS as a VMware guest

Seems to work fine inside VMWare Player 3, using the ISO as the
guest's CD-ROM, with the 'Debian 5' Guest OS preset.

Warn users when running inside a VM
===================================

Most of the work [[has been done|contribute/design/virtualization_support]].
Left to do:

* when running inside a non-free VM, suggest that the user switches to
  VirtualBox or some other free software VM: [[!taglink todo/code]];
  as the desktop notification windows are quite small, we'll
  have only use the notification system for showing the warning
  and point to proper documentation on the (local) wiki. [[!tag
  todo/documentation]]
* when running inside a VM within a non-free host OS, emphasize the
  pseudo-security situation; [[!taglink todo/research]] how to detect
  when the host OS is non-free; seems almost impossible :/

Resources
=========

* Incognito implementation
