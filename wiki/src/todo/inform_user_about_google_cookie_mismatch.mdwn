Torbutton 1.2.5 users receive a common CookieMismatch error from Google when trying to update Google account information, such as changing the password. https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2011-January/008460.html

It's resolved by setting extensions.torbutton.xfer_google_cookies to false, but the default true setting is probably more useful. Tails users could be notified of the workaround, by a link to the tor-talk message in the bookmarks toolbar.
