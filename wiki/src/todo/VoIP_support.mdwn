[[!tag todo/easy]]

We need to [[!taglink todo/research]] how VoIP can be usable in the
context of Tails.

Preliminary testing showed
[OnionCat](http://www.cypherpunk.at/onioncat/) +
[Mumble](http://mumble.sourceforge.net/) to be a working and
relatively easy to setup Tor-enabled VoIP solution; the 1/2s - 1s
delay is only slightly annoying.

As it was pointed out in the ["Adding voip to torchat"
thread](http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Dec-2010/msg00143.html) on
or-talk, OnionCat provides no bidirectional authentication: the caller
has (limited) certainty to be talking to the call receiver, but the
reverse is not true. So this shall be used in combination with zRTP or
similar.

Technologies
============

Encryption and authentication
-----------------------------

**Note**: these are relatively old notes that should be updated and
further researched.

On the UI side, something similar to Pidgin's OTR would be perfect.

### DTLS + SRTP

- IETF chose DTLS+SRTP over zRTP
- a PKI is needed to authenticate peers :/

### OTR

<http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2009/09/sip-communicators-summer-of-code.html>

### SRTP2 (SIPv4)

<http://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-kaplan-sip-four-oh-00.txt>

### zRTP

User-friendly peer authentication with a voice-based "short
authentication string". How strong is this?

Conferencing
------------

### RFC 4353

[[!rfc 4353]]: three-peers SIP conferencing, using one of them as a
central mixer.

### RFC 4575

[[!rfc 4575]]: N-peers SIP conference rooms, using one of the peers as
a central mixer. One can see who is saying what.

### Mixer-to-client Audio Level Indication

- [Latest IETF draft](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ivov-avt-slic-03)
as of 20110111.

A mechanism for RTP-level mixers in audio conferences to deliver
information about the audio level of the individual participants
=> helps detecting where bad noise comes from.

VoIP software
=============

**Last updated**: 20110905

Ekiga
-----

- in Debian Squeeze
- supposed to support zRTP... some day:
 * [their TODO item](https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=335594)
 * [last
   update](http://mail.gnome.org/archives/ekiga-devel-list/2009-April/msg00036.html)
   as of 200904
- supports IPv6 in 3.3.x (Debian experimental only, as of 20110905)
  but not before ([[!debbug 375056]], [upstream
  bug](https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=331041))

Linphone
--------

- [homepage](http://www.linphone.org/), [[!wikipedia Linphone desc="wikipedia page"]]
- in Debian Squeeze
- supports IPv6
- zRTP support [was asked
  for](http://www.archivum.info/linphone-developers@nongnu.org/2009-01/00013/(Linphone-developers)-Integrating-zRTP-protocol-into-LINphone.html)
  but, as of 02 Dec 2010, they have [no plans to implement
  it](http://www.mail-archive.com/linphone-users@nongnu.org/msg02640.html)
  without "customer funding"
* test results: 5-10s lag but one of us was using a really bad
  Internet connection

Mumble
------

- [homepage](http://mumble.sourceforge.net/), [[!wikipedia
  Mumble_(software) desc="wikipedia page"]]
- in Debian Squeeze
- primary engineering effort targeted at low-latency
- successfully tested in combination with OnionCat
- TLS and OCB-AES128; seems to depend on a PKI for peer authentication
- supports IPv6

SFLphone
--------

- [homepage](http://www.sflphone.org/), [[!wikipedia
  SFLphone desc="wikipedia page"]]
- in Debian Squeeze
- SIP
- Multiple audio conferencing
- TLS and zRTP
- doesn't seem to support IPv6:
  * [task #2863](https://projects.savoirfairelinux.com/issues/2863)
  * [task #1696](https://projects.savoirfairelinux.com/issues/1696)

Jitsi (SIP Communicator)
------------------------

- [homepage](http://jitsi.org/),  [[!wikipedia Jitsi desc="wikipedia page"]]
- LGPL, written in Java
- not in Debian (RFP: [[!debbug 627362]]); they ship binary Debian packages. The binary
  packages bundle more than 100 JAR files which probably makes
  packaging it for Debian a nightmare. [Packaging
  source](http://java.net/projects/jitsi/sources/svn/show/trunk/resources/install/debian)
  is available.
- supports IPv6, SIP, XMPP
- supports zRTP for key negotiation, SRTP for voice encryption, and
  TLS for signaling encryption
- supports audio SIP and XMPP conference calls; what conferencing protocol?
- supports OTR for text IM
- reported to work over Tor

Twinkle
-------

- [homepage](http://www.twinklephone.com/)
- in Debian Squeeze
- was included in Incognito
- supports SIP, zRTP et SRTP
- IPv6 is on the roadmap
- Qt application, but does not depend on KDE libs
- no release between 20090225 and 20110429 => asked on 20110510 for
  their plans; no answer so far
- it's the [client advised by GNU Telephony](http://www.gnutelephony.org/index.php/Secure_Call)

Jingle
------

- [[!wikipedia Jingle (protocol) desc="wikipedia page"]]
- Google Talk's XMPP extension

Empathy
-------

- [homepage](http://live.gnome.org/Empathy)
- SIP account => insists to connect to SIP server => impossible to
  setup a p2p voice call between onioncat IPv6 addresses, at least
  without registering SIP accounts.
- cannot connect to a XMPP server running behind a hidden service (2.30.3-3)
- Link-local XMPP connection manager ([[!debpkg telepathy-salut]]
  0.5.0-3) does not support voice calls

Zfone
-----

- [homepage](http://zfone.com/)
- allows to use zRTP on other VoIP software
- supposed to work with Ekiga
- some packages in Debian: libzrtpcpp-1.6-0, is that enough?
- last release was a public beta, out in March 2009
- license seems inadequate: according to [[!wikipedia Zfone]],
  "only the libZRTP SDK libraries are provided under the AGPL. The
  parts of Zfone that are not part of the libZRTP SDK libraries are
  not licensed under the AGPL or any other open source license.
  Although the source code of those components is published for peer
  review, they remain proprietary. The Zfone proprietary license also
  contains a time bomb provision."
