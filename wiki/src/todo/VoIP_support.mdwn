[[!tag todo/easy]]

We need to [[!taglink todo/research]] how VoIP can be usable in the
context of Tails.

Preliminary testing showed
[OnionCat](http://www.cypherpunk.at/onioncat/) +
[Mumble](http://mumble.sourceforge.net/) to be a working and
relatively easy to setup Tor-enabled VoIP solution; the 1/2s - 1s
delay is only slightly annoying.

As it was pointed out in the ["Adding voip to torchat"
thread](http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Dec-2010/msg00143.html) on
or-talk, OnionCat provides no bidirectional authentication: the caller
has (limited) certainty to be talking to the call receiver, but the
reverse is not true. So this shall be used in combination with zRTP or
similar.

Technologies
============

Encryption and authentication
-----------------------------

**Note**: these are relatively old notes that should be updated and
further researched.

On the UI side, something similar to Pidgin's OTR would be perfect.

### DTLS + SRTP

- IETF chose DTLS+SRTP over zRTP
- a PKI is needed to authenticate peers :/

### OTR

<http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2009/09/sip-communicators-summer-of-code.html>

### SRTP2 (SIPv4)

<http://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-kaplan-sip-four-oh-00.txt>

### zRTP

User-friendly peer authentication with a voice-based "short
authentication string". How strong is this?

Conferencing
------------

### RFC 4353

[[!rfc 4353]]: three-peers SIP conferencing, using one of them as a
central mixer.

### RFC 4575

[[!rfc 4575]]: N-peers SIP conference rooms, using one of the peers as
a central mixer. One can see who is saying what.

### Mixer-to-client Audio Level Indication

- [Latest IETF draft](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ivov-avt-slic-03)
as of 20110111.

A mechanism for RTP-level mixers in audio conferences to deliver
information about the audio level of the individual participants
=> helps detecting where bad noise comes from.

VoIP software
=============

**Last updated**: 20110905

Ekiga
-----

- in Debian Squeeze
- supposed to support zRTP... some day:
 * [their TODO item](https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=335594)
 * [last
   update](http://mail.gnome.org/archives/ekiga-devel-list/2009-April/msg00036.html)
   as of 200904
- supports IPv6 in 3.3.x (Debian experimental only, as of 20110905)
  but not before ([[!debbug 375056]], [upstream
  bug](https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=331041))

Linphone
--------

- [homepage](http://www.linphone.org/), [[!wikipedia Linphone desc="wikipedia page"]]
- in Debian Squeeze
- supports IPv6
- zRTP support [was asked
  for](http://www.archivum.info/linphone-developers@nongnu.org/2009-01/00013/(Linphone-developers)-Integrating-zRTP-protocol-into-LINphone.html)
  but, as of 02 Dec 2010, they have [no plans to implement
  it](http://www.mail-archive.com/linphone-users@nongnu.org/msg02640.html)
  without "customer funding"

Mumble
------

- [homepage](http://mumble.sourceforge.net/), [[!wikipedia
  Mumble_(software) desc="wikipedia page"]]
- in Debian Squeeze
- primary engineering effort targeted at low-latency
- successfully tested in combination with OnionCat
- TLS and OCB-AES128; seems to depend on a PKI for peer authentication
- supports IPv6

SFLphone
--------

- [homepage](http://www.sflphone.org/), [[!wikipedia
  SFLphone desc="wikipedia page"]]
- in Debian Squeeze
- SIP
- Multiple audio conferencing
- TLS and zRTP
- [[!taglink todo/test]] if it supports IPv6. It's pretty unclear from
  the outside:
  * [task #2863](https://projects.savoirfairelinux.com/issues/2863)
  * [task #1696](https://projects.savoirfairelinux.com/issues/1696)

Jitsi (SIP Communicator)
------------------------

- [homepage](http://jitsi.org/),  [[!wikipedia Jitsi desc="wikipedia page"]]
- LGPL, written in Java
- not in Debian; they ship binary Debian packages. The binary
  packages bundle more than 100 JAR files which probably makes
  packaging it for Debian a nightmare. [Packaging
  source](http://java.net/projects/jitsi/sources/svn/show/trunk/resources/install/debian)
  is available.
- supports IPv6, SIP, XMPP
- supports zRTP for key negotiation, SRTP for voice encryption, and
  TLS for signaling encryption
- supports audio SIP and XMPP conference calls; what conferencing protocol?
- supports OTR for text IM
- reported to work over Tor

Twinkle
-------

- [homepage](http://www.twinklephone.com/)
- in Debian Squeeze
- was included in Incognito
- supports SIP, zRTP et SRTP
- supports IPv6
- Qt application, but does not depend on KDE libs
- no release between 20090225 and 20110429 => asked on 20110510 for
  their plans
