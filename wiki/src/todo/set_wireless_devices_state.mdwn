At boot time (and probably at hotplug time too):

 * unblock Wi-Fi, WWAN and WiMAX
 * ignore Bluetooth (dealt with another way:
   [[todo/protect_against_external_bus_memory_forensics]])
 * soft-block all other kind of wireless devices (UWB, GPS, FM)

(See commit 4ad1490d in Liberté Linux Git.)

[[!tag todo/code]]

Write design documentation about this.

Write a short documentation page about how to manually unblock
a blocked device (e.g. GPS).
