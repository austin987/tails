[[!toc levels=2]]

Rationale
=========

It should not be that easy, for an attacker with physical access, to
retrieve Tails memory. (Note that this will especially be the case for
a [[Tails server|todo/server_edition]] instance left unattended.

Sub-tickets
===========

* [[todo/disable expresscard?]]
* [[todo/disable pcmcia?]]
* [[todo/disable_firewire?]]
* [[todo/support_bluetooth?]]

Roadmap
=======

* De-activate PCMCIA, ExpressCard, FireWire and Bluetooth, on systems
  that don't have any such devices plugged in after running for
  5 minutes. [[!tag todo/code]]
* Document how this works. [[!tag todo/documentation]]
* disable Thunderbolt?

Test for vulnerability
======================

* [inception](http://www.breaknenter.org/projects/inception/), "a
  FireWire physical memory manipulation and hacking tool". It
  supposedly supports "FireWire/Thunderbolt/ExpressCard/PCMCIA".

## other implementation ideas

* If a firewire card was inserted into the slot and the bus is active,
  pop up a dialog and ask "hey, you want to use firewire/etc.?"
* disable these buses by default, allow opt-in through tails-greeter
  to enable
* ask that users assert they want to use this or that bus, and make
  the assertion bind to a single device, rather than all devices
  blindly
* de-activate PCMCIA and ExpressCard on systems that don't have any
  PCMCIA or ExpressCard devices after running for 5 minutes. This is
  going to byte some users, but probably only the first time.
