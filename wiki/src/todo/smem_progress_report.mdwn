When we [[todo/erase_memory_on_shutdown]], users should be able to
have a better estimation of the time left or the estimated time for
the system to erase memory.

> Smem in verbose output dynamically echo one star character for each 512kb
> of mem it has erased, could be nicely parsed by a script. 

>> BleachBit (in Squeeze, not in Lenny) has some Python code that
>> wipes the memory. It might be easier to replace smem with it, in
>> order to provide the needed progress bar.

>>> See commit 9f54b7dfe9 in amnesia's [[live-initramfs
>>> repo|contribute/git]]. Not tagging done yet as this has neither been merged into
>>> our master branch yet, nor been integrated into our main repo as
>>> a custom `.deb`.
>>>
>>> Bleachbit code wasn't reusable, its output isn't enougly factorized to
>>> implement a progressbar. It would have meant rewriting all the logic, which
>>> is in python and quite different from the good old and proven C smem.
>>>
>>> Finally, all the magic is done in a script that parse smem's output. It's
>>> also taking care to manage linux happyness on memory overcommitment, so that
>>> smem has enough rights to do its work.

>>> The `sleep 10` magic number must either be
>>> tested in really various situations (e.g. after working on huge
>>> pictures stored on a USB stick), or replaced by a clever way to
>>> guess the really needed waiting time at runtime.

>>>> After testing, it appears that five seconds are enough.

>>>>> No progress bar to end with, as we tweaked smem invocation so
>>>>> that it now takes only a few seconds.
