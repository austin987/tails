Please update Torbutton to 1.2.3 or later. There are very annoying
bugs in previous versions, some of which have security implications.
The current version, 1.2.1, is a whole year old.

> AFAIK, amnesia 0.4.2 includes torbutton 1.2.4.

>> It does not. I am using amnesia 0.4.2 right now and it includes torbutton 1.2.1. In iceweasel, check Tools -> Add-ons -> Extensions to confirm this.
