0. install Tor 0.2.3 (`feature/Tor_0.2.3` branch) [[!tag todo/code]]
0. have the most obvious Tails identifiable behaviours use separate
   streams, by running each of them over a different SocksPort:
   * htpdate:
     <https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2012-July/001394.html>
   * more? see [[network fingerprint]]
0. use the separate streams feature (e.g. separate web / IM / GNOME proxy)


For [[!taglink release/1.0]], we decided we want basic Tor stream isolation.
