There's an expensive (in time and bandwidth) bootstrap process
necessary for getting I2P going (generate keys, fetch network database
and hosts file, etc.). This can easily be avoided by making
`/var/lib/i2p` persistent, so a preset should be added.

When we implement this we should enable I2P's "Laptop mode" (Change
router identity and UDP port when IP changes for enhanced anonymity).
