Use cases
=========

Secretly work on a document
---------------------------

John, Jane and Miranda would like to secretly work on a
document.

Possible solutions follow.

### 1. Centrally hosted Etherpad

Tails can be used to access a centrally hosted Etherpad.

Their physical location and identities should be properly concealed
but the document itself can be intercepted by the server operators.

They would like to have other means than blind trust to keep the
secrecy.

### 2. OpenPGP-encrypted messages in a shared mailbox or a drop.io space

Tails can be used to pass GnuPG-encrypted messages through a shared
mailbox or a drop.io space.

This sounds like a pretty good answer but they are under a lot of
pressure and are likely to make mistakes. Leaking a clear-text version
to the service provider would be fairly easy under stress.

### 3. Gobby and SFTP servers behind a Tails-powered Tor hidden service

Anyone amongst John, Jane and Miranda could use Tails to host Gobby
and SFTP servers behind a Tor hidden service. Others would also use
Tails to reach them.

Keeping such servers at hand, on a live system, behind an hidden
service is likely to prevent erroneous disclosure.

The Tails *server edition* vision
===================================

This vision aims at making it easy for end-users to implement
solutions described above and based on Tor hidden services hosted on a
Tails system.

Tails server should content itself with hardware that is a bit old
(such as a PIII-450 laptop with 256MB of RAM) and broken (e.g. no
screen).

Tails server should be able to run common services like a web
server, a Jabber daemon, wiki, file repository, etc.

Data and configuration for services would be stored on an encrypted
flash media. Targeted hardware to run "Tails server" would be an
old laptop with broken hard-disk, battery, screen or keyboard;
something quite common these days.

Setting up a new server would be done by:

1. plugging a flash media into a running desktop Tails system,
2. configuring the services through a pretty simple GUI,
3. removing the flash media, now encrypted and containing the
   services configuration,
4. putting a "Tails server" CD or USB stick in the old laptop and
   plugging the flash media,
5. once booted, the flash media encryption passphrase can be entered
   directly using the keyboard or through a web interface in the
   local network,
6. service is ready to be used by any Tor user once they got
   a hold on the hidden service address.

Implementation
==============

Switch to "server mode" at boot time
------------------------------------

What follows is a preliminary implementation plan that allows us to
ship ISO images that are able to boot in "server mode" or in "desktop
mode".

This should be refined to integrate better into the standard Debian
Live boot process. E.g. the standard persistence support should be
used to iterate over block devices, find the one that contains the
server configuration and decrypt it.

When starting a server we *must* have the server configuration present
on a USB drive during boot, so we can simply check for its presence
with a hook in early init. If present, then we enter server mode and
don't start X, network manager, etc., otherwise we just boot Tails
in the normal fashion.

Elaborating on my suggestion above, what I describe below will have the
server mode init sequence logic happily contained in two init scripts
that are specifically made for this purpose, so no other init scripts
will be bloated with conditionals or altered in any way:

As I said, we introduce two new init scripts:

1. `server-check`, which is run as early as possible (i.e. as
   soon as the filesystem is up and we can mount USB drives)
2. `server-mode`, which is run once the network is up

`server-check` will loop through all USB drives (even the one Tails
is running from if running from USB) and for each `$X` of them, in
turn:

1. mount `$X`
2. check if `$X` contains an encrypted server configuration, e.g.
   something like `[[ -f /mounted/usb/encrypted-server-conf ]]`
3. if the check failed: unmount `$X`, then continue to loop
4. if the check succeeds: keep `$X` mounted, exit the loop, and:
 4a. remove Xorg, network manager, etc. from the boot sequence
 4b. write the path to the configuration to a state file e.g.:

	echo "/mounted/usb/encrypted-server-conf" >
	  > /var/lib/live/tails-server-mode

So, if no drive contained a server configuration (i.e. all 3 and no 4
in the loop) `server-check` exits and boot continues as usual. If a
server config was encountered, its path is written to
`/var/lib/live/tails-server-mode`, which should only exist in this
case, and the USB drive containing it will be mounted.

`server-mode` will check if the server state file exists and contains
a valid path to a file, namely the server configuration. If the check
fails, boot continues as usual, otherwise the server-mode service
will, in chronological order, take care of:

1. receiving the configuration encryption password some how
2. decrypting $(cat /var/lib/live/tails-server-mode)
3. starting the ssh daemon, http server, wiki software, etc.
   using their decrypted configuration files
4. updating torrc with the decrypted configuration
5. sending tor a SIGHUP so it will reload its configuration and
   finally start the hidden service(s)

If any of the above fails an appropriate error message should be shown
to the user. Possibly we could start X and network manager (i.e. like
in a normal boot) show the error there and then let the user try to
sort out the error, e.g. by mounting the server configuration and
editing the faulty config file, or by using the GUI you talked about
to create a completely new server configuration.

Persistence
-----------

This server mode feature heavily depends on the [[todo/persistence]]
todo item.

Persistence shall always be opt-in in Tails. On the other hand a USB
stick dedicated to running a Tails server should be ideally be
bootable without a screen / keyboard which brings new issues:

- how to toggle persistence on in that case? shall we patch the
  bootloader menu to do so?
- how to enter the encryption passphrase? web interface available on
  the LAN?

### Vidalia's hidden services support

Works mostly well but we need to [[!taglink todo/wait]] for [[!tor_bug
2579]] to be fixed.

### The Incognito implementation

The old Incognito actually has a very rudimentary support for hidden
services which was setup in a similar way. However, it is limited to
hosting static html pages using lighthttpd, but the script used might
be worth looking at:
