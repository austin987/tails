Hello!

Basically, there are two features I need very, very much:

1) persistence support, even meager one would do. 
I know there's pretty sophisticated solution "in the works", but TBH a meager "stopgap" one that would allow me to have iceweasel bookmarks and some additional packages installed would go a very long way to increase usability.

2) please include Mixminion w/gui by default. Mixminion is pretty awesome as-is and on 2 september of this year it was announced that active development is to resume.

> Count another request for Mixminion. Incognito used to have it. Very useful.

>> Closing after more than a year of inactivity. [[!tag todo/done]]
