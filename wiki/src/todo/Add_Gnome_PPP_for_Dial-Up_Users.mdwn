# Rationale

Tails should be usable by those stuck with dial-up Internet access. Recent
events have shown that in some cases, dial-up might be the last option to
reach the Internet when broadband operators have been shut down.

# Research

NetworkManager (and ModemManager) have full support for **mobile** modems. But
nothing for old school dial-up modems at the moment: see [b.g.o #348330 -
Tracker: Integrated PPP support](https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=348330)

Fallback option: provide GNOME PPP, a GUI front-end to old but trusty WvDial.

# Dial-up emulation

Here is a method to test dial-up PPP connections without resorting to a real modem
and a real Internet provider available on the Plain Old Telephony System. It needs
a system running Tails and another one (the *gateway*) running standard Debian.
So this requires either two computers in the same LAN or runing Tails using
virtualization.

1. Prepare the networking stack on the *gateway* :

        # iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
        # sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1

2. In Tails, create `.wvdial.conf`:

        [Dialer Defaults]
        Baud = 115200
        Init = ATZ
        Init2 = AT%R1
        Phone = 192.168.1.2:6789
        Username = test
        Password = test
        Carrier Check = off

   Replace the IP address in `Phone` with the IP address of the other system.

3. In Tails, install the `modemu` package.

4. In Tails, remove the default route to let room for the one provided by PPP:

        # ip route del default

5. On the *gateway* run:

        # pppd noauth local lock nodefaultroute persist debug nodetach 10.1.2.3:10.4.5.6 pty "nc -l 6789"

6. And fairly quickly (before `pppd` times out), run on Tails:

        $ sudo modemu -c 'ln -nsf %s /dev/modem ; wvdial -c .wvdial.conf'

Repeat the last two steps if the connection is broken at some point.

# PPPoE emulation

To ensure that PPPoE (broadband DSL) support is not broken by tweaks
to PPP configuration files, here is a test procedure. This needs
a standard Debian system (the *gateway*), and either a spare wired network card
or using virtualization.

This reciepe uses `kvm`, but could be easily adapted to other setups:

1. On the *gateway*, install the `pppoe` package.
2. On the *gateway*, create `/etc/ppp/pppoe-server-options`:

        debug
        noauth
        lcp-echo-interval 10
        lcp-echo-failure 2
        ms-dns 8.8.8.8
        defaultroute
        noipdefault

3. Start KVM, adding those arguments: `-net nic,model=virtio -net tap,ifname=tails`.
4. On the *gateway*, *up* this interface:

        # ip link set tails up

5. On the *gateway*, start the PPPoE server:

        # sudo pppoe-server -I tails -F -S test -m 1412

6. On Tails, you can now right-click the NetworkManager icon, and select
   *Edit connections…*. In the *DSL* tab, click *Add*. *Service name*
   should be set to `test`. Other settings should not matter.

7. On Tails, left-click the NetworkManager icon and selection the newly
   created connection.

To debug, use `tcpdump`, and look at `/var/log/syslog`.

# Implementation

As WvDial (and thus GNOME PPP) is not integrated with NetworkManager in any
way, the hooks in `/etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d` are not normally run upon
connection.

They will be after adding the following script as
`/etc/ppp/ip-up.d/010call-nm-hooks`:

    #!/bin/sh

    run-parts --regex='^[a-z0-9-]+(\.sh)?$' /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d --arg="$1" --arg="up"

But this will probably have the undesired effect of calling NetworkManager
hooks twice when using PPPoE. Is that a problem? [[!taglink todo/research]]
