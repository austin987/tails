The [[documentation about Pidgin and OTR|doc/anonymous_internet/pidgin/]] should be improved.

Pidgin
======

  - Mention the Tails channel and link it from [[support/talk]].
  - Document the random nick preset, see
    [[/todo/Pidgin___40__documentation__41__]].
  - Incorporate the findings on [[todo/Pidgin_Protocol_Review]].

OTR
===

- Link to the [homepage of OTR](http://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr/) and
  quote their introduction paragraph.
- There is a decent documentation for OTR in [Security in-a-box: How to
  Use OTR to Initiate a Secure Messaging Session in
  Pidgin](https://securityinabox.org/en/pidgin_securechat).
- [[!taglink todo/research]] how we get external documentation translated
- Get the OTR upstream to link this documentation from their homepage.

> How about the documentation pages linked from the OTR GUI itself?
> IIRC they are pretty good too, and at least some are translated.
> --intrigeri
