Message-ID
==========

T(A)ILS currently sets `domain=localhost` in `accountrc.tmpl`.

An account created from this template on T(A)ILS devel branch (Debian
Squeeze, Claws Mail 3.7.6-4) ends up with `set_domain=0` and
`domain=`, and the `Message-ID` is generated using the hostname part
of the sender's email address.

T(A)ILS 0.6 uses the same Claws Mail version (from Debian backports).

EHLO/HELO
=========

Outgoing EHLO/HELO SMTP commands can also leak private information
(see [this or-talk thread about
it](http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Aug-2008/msg00261.html)).

According to our tests claws-mail always says `EHLO localhost`,
whatever value the `domain` is set to.

HTML / Javascript
=================

Optional plugins (fancy, dillo, html2, etc.) can render HTML e-mail.
Without any of them, claws-mail does basic HTML formatting (e.g.
links) by default. The `render_html` prefs item, when set to false,
fully disables HTML rendering.

T(A)ILS currently uses the following HTML-related settings:

	render_html=0
	invoke_plugin_on_html=0
	promote_html_part=0
