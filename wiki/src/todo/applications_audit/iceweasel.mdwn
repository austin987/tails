browser fingerprinting
----------------------

See the [Panopticlick](https://panopticlick.eff.org/) tool, by the
EFF, for fingerprinting tests and stats.

For information about the relative protection torbutton offers against
this kind of leak, see

* [the post on the Tor
  blog](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/effs-panopticlick-and-torbutton)
* [this thread on
  or-talk](http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Jan-2010/msg00259.html)

Check amnesia's own User Agent settings:

* can Torbutton update them?
* do we lighten Torbutton's protection in any way? if so, shall we go
  on doing this? e.g.
  - do we set a custom or localized timezone, instead of Torbutton's
    default (GMT)?
  - do we send custom or localized preferred languages for
    Content Negotiation?

Firefox 3.5 or later
--------------------

- turn off geolocation from the beginning in the browser preferences.
  New versions of Torbutton disable geolocation, but only when
  Torbutton is in "enabled" mode
- It may also be a good idea to disable prefetching.
