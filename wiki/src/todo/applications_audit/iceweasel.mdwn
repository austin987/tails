Done

Almost everything, as long as we use an up to date Torbutton: Mike
Perry, the torbutton maintainer, has a pretty good idea of what
he's doing.

TODO

browser fingerprinting
----------------------

See the [Panopticlick](https://panopticlick.eff.org/) tool, by the
EFF, for fingerprinting tests and stats.

For information about the relative protection torbutton offers against
this kind of leak, see

* [the fingerprinting section of the Torbutton design document](https://www.torproject.org/torbutton/en/design/index.html.en#fingerprinting)
* [the post on the Tor blog](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/effs-panopticlick-and-torbutton).
  story that began with questions about torbutton vs private browsing mode (see this 
  [blog post on torproject](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/firefox-private-browsing-mode-torbutton-and-fingerprinting) and started discussions [inside mozilla project](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Fingerprinting).
* [this thread on
  or-talk](http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Jan-2010/msg00259.html)

Check T(A)ILS User Agent settings:

* can Torbutton update them?
* do we lighten Torbutton's protection in any way? if so, shall we go
  on doing this? e.g.
  - do we set a custom or localized timezone, instead of Torbutton's
    default (GMT)?
  - do we send custom or localized preferred languages for
    Content Negotiation?

> The devel branch now enables Torbutton's US English locale spoofing.

Firefox 3.5 or later
--------------------

- turn off geolocation from the beginning in the browser preferences.
  New versions of Torbutton disable geolocation, but only when
  Torbutton is in "enabled" mode
- It may also be a good idea to disable prefetching.
