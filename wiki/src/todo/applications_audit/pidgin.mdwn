Local time leak through CTCP-TIME requests
------------------------------------------

Pidgin leaks this piece of information if you use the IRC More plugin.
The original Incognito patches it to disable CTCP completely.

Jabber DNS leak bug
-------------------

Need to investigate around the [DNS leaks bug](http://developer.pidgin.im/ticket/11110) when using jabber. 
Still as it's a SRV request leak, Tails should be safe until it becomes able
to resolv something else thant just A requests. TBB has it's own
ticket ([[!tor_bug 1676]]) for this issue.
