A bunch of anonymity, privacy and security issues in Polipo were fixed
in Christopher Davis' branch (git://repo.or.cz/polipo.git) and never
merged upstream.

We should check if these issues affect Tails.

# dontIdentifyToClients

Christopher added the `dontIdentifyToClients` option (commits:
80b45940, be116b5, c78beb81) to fix [[!tor_bug 1082]]. When set to
true, "Polipo tries to avoid transmitting local host name, port, and
time zone".

1. *hostname* and *port*: Tails sets `proxyName = "localhost"` and
   `proxyPort = 8118` just like the Tor Browser Bundle does => nothing
   critical could be leaked - at worse, leaking this information
   restricts the practical anonymity set to the best one Tails can try
   putting its users into => **non-issue**.

2. Leaking *timezone* information to the outside world would be much
   more annoying: Tails' web browser has been trying to spoof a EN-US
   browser since 0.7 for a reason. However, as far as I understand the
   code and patches, that information can only be transmitted to a
   HTTP *client* connected to Polipo (... and the option name tends to
   confirm my guess); practically speaking, such a client can be any
   non-SOCKS-aware applications shipped in Tails and has other means
   to gather that information anyway, so why would it be problem if
   Polipo leaks it? => someone else than me should double-check all
   this since I can very possibly be misunderstanding something along
   the way => **[[!taglink todo/research]]**.

# others?

Security issues that were not privacy-related have supposedly already
been applied to the 1.0.4.1-1.1 polipo package shipped in Debian
Squeeze. This should be double-checked, though
=> **[[!taglink todo/research]]**.
