Rationale
=========

If running from the USB drive and it is removed, it would
be nice to wipe memory and reboot when the USB drive is removed: if
you're in a persecuted country and they are on to you, you can grab
the USB and leave.

Current state
=============

Implemented and pending for 0.7. Left to do:

  - design documentation
  - end-user documentation (started in `doc-rework` in `doc/use/desktop`)

Inspiration
===========

A simple udev rule should do the job. It should be triggered by
`ACTION=="remove"`, and be really careful to detect whether the system
is running from the just-removed USB stick.

The implementation difficulty arises from the fact that smem must be
permanently kept in RAM after boot, along with what's needed to make
the command run by the udev rule work. Possible solution: run smem on
boot, immediately SIGSTOP it, and SIGCONT it when the USB stick
is unplugged.

[Liberté Linux](http://dee.su/liberte) has some kind of watchdog that
does something alike these lines (i.e. at least shutdown the box):

- they pre-cache needed programs in a directory in `/dev/shm`
- they have a udev watchdog written in C, which is supposed to be more
  reliable than udev rules.
