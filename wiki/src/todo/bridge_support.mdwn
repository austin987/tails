Given the increasing practice of blocking Tor usage in more
authoritarian countries, censorship resistance is getting more
important. To merely try use Tor might even be dangerous in these
countries as the government can log it an take action against the
user. Hence we should provide an easy to use facility for our users to

* make sure that they always can reach the Tor network, and
* prevent others from knowing that they are using Tor.

In Tor there is the concept of
[bridges](http://www.torproject.org/bridges) which is used to hide the
fact that you are communicating with the Tor network by relaying your
Tor traffic through a so called bridge node which is not listed in
Tor's directory. This is exactly what we want.

Bridges in amnesia
==================

While Vidalia makes it straight-forward to use bridges there are some
special considerations that needs to be accounted for in the context
of amnesia. Since all Tor is started at boot, it is immediately
disclosed that Tor is used. We need to make it possible for our users
to prevent this, for instance by toggling some option in the boot
menu. However, since all internet traffic is routed through Tor, if a
user don't know of any bridges we have a catch-22 situation since the
user's best possibility to get a bridge is by getting it ovver the
internet, for instance from [the Tor project's
website](https://bridges.torproject.org/), IRC or IM buddies and
similar.


Specification
=============

The use of bridges should be optional, and if desired it must be
chosen before Tor starts. The best place for such an option is
probably in the boot menu. When activated the following things should
happen:

* Tor doesn't try to connect to the Tor network.
* The user is somehow helped to setup a bridge, and possibly
  instructed how to get one.
* Once a bridge has been chosen, Tor should immediately start to use
  it.

Implementation
==============

There are numerous ways to design and implement this. Here are some
things to analyse and discuss:

* We have to decide whether we want to use vidalia's existing settings
  for it or a more homebrew scripted version.
 - A scripted version is of course more powerful as it would let us do anything.
 - The vidalia approach is easier to implement but leaves the burden
   of finding the Vidalia settings and typing shit to the user.

* Vidalia has a "Find bridges now" button which won't work for us
  since it can't reach bridges.torproject.org. To get it to work we
  would need some kind of exception in the firewall rules.

* The following command is an easy way to download a list of bridges
  (requires an exception in the firewall table -- perhaps we can just
  run the command as the debian-tor user which has direct internet
  access?):
  `wget -q -O - https://bridges.torproject.org/ | grep -e "^bridge .*"`
 - It should be noted that just connecting to bridges.torproject.org
   can be dangerous if the regime is hostile towards Tor, and/or it
   could simply be censored. This must be explained to the user, and
   manual input of bridges must be available as an alternative.

* To get Tor to not connect to the Tor network, one can just add
  "ReachableAddresses reject *:*" to torrc. When the user has selected
  bridges, we then add them and "UseBridges 1" to torrc, and remove
  the "Reach... *:*", and sends a SIGHUP to the tor client and it will
  get going again.

* Alternatively one could add the bridges through Tor's control port
  (the way I assume vidalia and TorK does it).
 - Since these settings disappear if Tor restarts, this is potentially
   dangerous.

* Yet another alternative is of course to either delay the start of
  the tor init script until the bridges has been set up, or that the
  script runs during init, before tor, but then it would have to be
  text-mode.
