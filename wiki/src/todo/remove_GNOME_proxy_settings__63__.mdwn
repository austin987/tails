that "Tails stopped using transparent proxy configuration in order to
try to keep random crap on the system from linking the user's
web-browsing activities, but still configures Tor as the GNOME default
SOCKS proxy, which defeats most of that purpose."

This is wrong: the main reason to drop transparent proxying was to
avoid leaking the local IP, to which applications bind, and *not* to
avoid random GNOME applications to access the network.

But still, we might not want to give random applications access to the
network. Maybe we should remove this setting, and instead explicitly
torify, in another way, the applications we really want to access the
network and that are currently relying on the GNOME settings?

This looks quite possible, but a few corner cases, such as the
"Connect to a server" GNOME feature, would probably be broken and hard
to torify in another not-too-hackish way.

Moreover, now that we have [[Tor stream
isolation|todo/separate_Tor_streams]], the linking of
GNOME-proxy-compliant software connections with e.g. web browsing is
much less of a problem.

So, is the minimal added security worth the additional development and
maintenance work?
