While trying to keep the ISO image as small as possible we spotted some
unwanted file we could get rid of :

  - /usr/share/inkscape/examples
  - /usr/share/inkscape/tutorials
  - changelog.gz and changelog.Debian.gz in /usr/share/doc

For the moment there's a script doing that in
config/chroot_local-hooks/98-remove_unwanted_files.

We want to add the selective deletion of scribus translation files
rather do the whole deletion using dpkg's --path-include and
--path-exclude options, as described in :

http://raphaelhertzog.com/2010/11/15/save-disk-space-by-excluding-useless-files-with-dpkg/

Dealing with the scribus files would imply generating a
/etc/dpkg/dpkg.cfg.d/excludes file from the AMNESIA_SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES
during the build process.

Maybe this should be done through the 'amnesia' config script itself?
