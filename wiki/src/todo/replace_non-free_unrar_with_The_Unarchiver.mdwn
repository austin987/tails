The recent inclusion of non-Free Software in Tails is quite unfortunate, considering that TheUnarchive has recently gained RARv3 support, which unrar-free didn't have.

I don't know whether TheUnarchiver is packaged by Debian, but Trisquel, a 100% Free indirect derivative thereof (that you might want to rebase onto, for a 100% Free baseline) is already shipping it, so you might want to at least borrow that one package.
