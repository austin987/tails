People have raised an issue about the predictable/fingerprintable
"random" nicks we generate for pidgin on both #tails and #tor (and
IRL, actually) a couple of times, and I see no reason why they cannot
be made more random looking. However, since pidgin auto-joins #tails,
maybe that alone outs them as Tails users any way?

In any case, what I propose below would not make things worse, but if
it makes our users more happy, then I'm happy to implement it
(actually I will have to bash this up any way for a completely other
project of mine, so from my side it will just be a copy-paste and git
push).

Christopher Pound's [name confluxer](http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~pound/)
could easily fix this. Given a data set of names it will generate
names that sound/seem similar to the ones in the data set. I've tried
feeding the same source as we currently use, i.e. the 2000 most common
US names, into it, and it has generated mostly convincing stuff.
Here's a sample: Martony, Urshardeus, Bobera, Gorgio, Cricey,
Codollina, Aaradret, Elvist, Llormaynt, Guancioni. lc always generates
names with the first letter in upper-case, but I would make them
completely lower case with some large (90% I'd say) probability,
though.

After prodding Chris about the license for lc, he chose the MIT
license, so it's ready for distribution and use in Tails.

Go or no?
