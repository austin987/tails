[[!taglink todo/research]]

Our current approach to managing Tails [[/todo]] and [[/bugs]] does
not scale. We have some nice ideas to improve it slightly, but it's
not clear the result will be good enough.

We definitely need, in addition to what ikiwiki gives us:

* easily track a given subset of tasks/issues
* easily know what's planned and going to happen: more
  project-management meta-data (milestone, priority, assigned to, etc.)
* advanced search queries

We definitely want to keep, among what ikiwiki gives us:

* Git-like offline usage and merge support; branches would be welcome;
  perhaps this simply means: *Git backend*
* each task/issue can be *maintained* and constantly *updated* like an
  evolving design page, as opposed to a long Trac discussion -- e.g.
  our [[todo/persistence]] todo item in *just* Trac would've been an
  absolute nightmare, even if it was nicely split up into smaller
  sub-tasks

> I think I could live without branches, too. -- intrigeri

Additionally, we may need:

* integrated discussion that's easier to follow than ikiwiki's
  indented replies; such a discussion feature'd better be as good as
  email if it wants to be used.

# Available options

## Trac

* [email2trac utilities](https://subtrac.sara.nl/oss/email2trac/)

## Redmine

* [homepage](http://www.redmine.org)
* supports [issue creation or comments via
  email](http://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/RedmineReceivingEmails),
  and it [looks
  like](https://we.riseup.net/cgdev/using-email-with-redmine#sending-emails)
  it's possible to update ticket attributes over email, but this
  should be checked; apparently, there no more powerful way to
  interact with it asynchronously ([feature request for offline
  mode](http://www.redmine.org/issues/2728))
