Our current approach to managing Tails [[/todo]] and [[/bugs]] does
not scale. We have some nice ideas to improve it slightly, but it's
not clear the result will be good enough.

# Roadmap

On the Redmine side, we should [[!taglink todo/test]] offline usage
[intrigeri] and the plugins we're interested in [nobody].

On the Bugs Everywhere side, we should think how hard the missing B.E.
features would be to implement. [[!taglink todo/research]]

# Wiki / Tasks

Let's keep our wiki for blueprints and research for long-term big next
features.

Let's try not to use the wiki for tasks (else it defeats the purpose of
tracking tasks), let's not try to use the tasks manager for research and other
things that would be better suited for the wiki (else it harms mostly-offline
developers).

# Specifications

## Must have

 * Should have categories (and display the related tasks in a meaningful way).
   => Redmine, bugs-everywhere
 * Should let us assign tasks to individuals
   => bugs-everywhere
 * Can handle tasks and sub-tasks
   => Redmine, bugs-everywhere
 * Create tickets over email.
   => Redmine, bugs-everywhere
 * Reply to tickets over email.
   => bugs-everywhere
 * Being able to search through tickets offline (caching).
   Ability to import a DB dump into a local instance of the webapp would be
   an acceptable way to do it, even if clearly suboptimal.
   => bugs-everywhere
 * Email notifications: subscribing to a ticket, or to new tickets, etc.
   => Redmine (for existing tickets), bugs-everywhere
 * Advanced search queries, or filters (among metadata)
   (roadmap, milestone, overview, individual dashboard)
   => Redmine
 * Hosted somewhere else **or** fully available in Debian
   (or all deps in Debian? to be discussed if need arises.)
   => Redmine (Riseup Labs & in a little bit outdated Debian),
      bugs-everywhere (needs some care)
 * milestones (target version)
   => Redmine, bugs-everywhere
 * Random users may reply to tasks.
   => bugs-everywhere

## Important

 * Blocking property
   => Redmine, bugs-everywhere
 * Change a ticket's metadata via email.
   => bugs-everywhere
 * Due time, deadlines
   => Redmine (with email reminders), bugs-everywhere

## Bonus

 * Having tags
   => bugs-everywhere
 * Possible to assign tasks to a team / to multiple people
 * Sub-tasks having precedence support or wait state or something that makes
   the "let's create all future sub-tickets for a task at the same time"
   workflow practically doable (i.e. I don't want to be shown all future steps
   that are blocked by the first one)
 * Possible to change a ticket's state from Git commit messages (todo->pending),
   bonus points if merging that branch into stable ->done, or something like
   that.
  * Reminder for deadlines.

## Unsorted

 * Encryption support.

# Past experiences

* intrigeri: I've used Trac in the past. I've recently started using Redmine, and
  like it much better. Doesn't know anything about their email interface.
* ague: Trac & Redmine
* bertagaz: Redmine is faster and easier to use, good UI. Taohe-LAFS' Trac is
  quite nicely organized.

# Available options

## Trac

* [email2trac utilities](https://subtrac.sara.nl/oss/email2trac/)

## Redmine

* [homepage](http://www.redmine.org)
* easy to setup thanks to the Debian package
* supports [issue creation or comments via
  email](http://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/RedmineReceivingEmails),
* supports [updating ticket attributes over
  email](https://we.riseup.net/cgdev/using-email-with-redmine#sending-emails)
* the email interface, according to someone I trust who set it up and
  uses it, is quite fragile and can be a bit mysterious to setup
* apparently, there no more powerful way to interact with it
  asynchronously ([feature request for offline
  mode](http://www.redmine.org/issues/2728))
* [[!debpkg redmine-plugin-markdown]]

## Bugs everywhere

* [Homepage](http://bugseverywhere.org/)
* General impression: nice
* Compliance: yes but
  - there are no *true* subtickets but depends
  - it is not anymore in Debian because the maintainer was not willing to
    take care of its outdated package anymore. Other bugs were wishlist.
* Features
  - totally distributed
  - very nice command line interface
  - nice BTS-like email interface
  - minimal web interface (viewing and commenting bugs)
  - well written, simple to customize

Let's see if it is possible to use Bugs Everywhere while not making
the entry barrier too high for new contributors.

### First interaction: looking

The static web output looks good enough, doesn't it?

### Second interaction: commenting

#### Solution A

Let's add <mailto:> links with the subject prepared to ease replying
to a comment over email.

(Note: supposed to work with GMail + Chrome. And others?)

#### Solution B

Let's add an option to allow a single (anonymous) action in the web
interface: commenting... while disabling other kinds of changes.

Pros: more familiar to some kind of potential new contributors.

Cons: we have to handle comments spam somehow. Urghl.

### Third interaction: assigning to self

#### Solution A: over Git

Let's allow _anonymous_ Git push to our Bugs Everywhere repository.

Changing a ticket's metadata then requires cloning, installing Bugs
Everywhere, running a `be` command or doing the changes inside the
(local) web interface, and then commit + push.

#### Solution B: over email

Sending an email whose body includes a command phrased as a special
pseudo-header.

#### Discussion

Both are clearly non-trivial, but probably not harder than
understanding our tasks workflow and processes ;) Yes, it adds to the
list of what you have to learn to contribute.

### Fourth interaction: subscribing to a ticket

The command-line interface allows subscribing to email notifications
(all changes, or only ticket creation, or specific tickets).

Presumably one may use email commands to subscribe. [[!tag
todo/research]] If it is the case, then we can have the web interface
display a <mailto:> link on each ticket page to subscribe to it.
