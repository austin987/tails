Rationale
=========

* Git becomes sluggish, mainly due to binary and source Debian
  packages we've been storing in Git.
* We've never taken advantage of mixing website with sources,
  so we only experience the disadvantages of it.

Our plan
========

New Git repositories
--------------------

... with history imported and rewritten to filter out parts that were
splitted out:

* `tails-live.git`: the Tails source code we feed live-build with
* `tails-website.git`: the source of this website (i.e. more or less
  what is currently in `wiki/src`

APT repository
--------------

See the [[dedicated TODO page|todo/APT_repository]].

.mrconfig
---------

A few teams, such as the debian-installer and Debian Perl ones, that
use many Git repositories (thousands, in case of the latter), have
been successfully using [[!debpkg mr]] to make an initial checkout
easier for new contributors, and generally making it easier to deal
with a lot of repositories (mass-update, etc.). We could do the same,
starting with maintaining and publishing a `.mrconfig` file.

Additional custom repositories we use and may want to include in this
`.mrconfig`: whisperback, live-boot, live-config, vidalia, htp,
tails-greeter.

We probably should ship two mrconfig files: one that uses anonymous
`git://` read-only remotes, the other that uses `ssh://`
read-write remotes.

Next things to do
=================

Setting up the [[APT repository]] and migrating the website to its own
Git repository can be done in parallel to start with. Rewriting the
`tails-live.git` history can come later.
