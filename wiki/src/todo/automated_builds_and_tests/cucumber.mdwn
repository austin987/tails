[[!meta title="Automated tests using cucumber"]]

[[!toc levels=2]]

About this
==========

This is a glue between:

* [Sikuli](http://www.sikuli.org/), used for simulating user
  interaction,
* [libvirt](http://libvirt.org/), used for running a specific build of
  Tails in a virtual machine, and
* [cucumber](http://cukes.info/), to write features with scenarios to
  be tested by the above two components.

Its goal is to automate the release testing process with a Continuous
Integration server, or for developers to implement features the "Agile
Way".


Features
========

With this tool, it is possible to:

  * Create, modify and destroy virtual machines meant to run Tails.
  * Simulate user interaction with the Tails virtual machine, and test
    its state.
  * Run arbitrary shell commands inside the virtual machine.
  * Take screenshots from the display of the virtual machine, at
    particular events, like when a scenario fails. Complete test
    sessions can also be captured into a video.
  * Capture and analyse Tails virtual machine network traffic.
  * Create different kinds of virtual storage (ide, USB, DVD, ...),
    and either cold or hot plug/unplug them to the virtual machine.


Setup and usage
===============

The setup and usage documentation is being worked on along with the
code, on the `feature/automated_tests/cucumber` WIP branch:

* `contribute/release_process/test/setup.mdwn`
* `contribute/release_process/test.mdwn`


TODO and issues
===============

## Merge this branch

1. Fix blockers:
   - Support "slow" systems
   - Design documentation
1. Draw serious plans to make the JRuby / Sikuli / C extensions
   solution sustainable for us.
1. Split non-blockers into separate tickets.
1. List the tests and their current status: needs-implementation,
   needs-review, needs-to-pass-for-someone-else. This should be done
   by building upon the "Tests from our manual test suite not yet
   covered" list.
1. Merge this branch.

## Tests from our manual test suite not yet covered

The below points refer to the tests in [[contribute/release_process/test]]:

* Iceweasel
  - does the exposed User-Agent match the TBB's one?
  - Running `getTorbuttonUserAgent` should produce the useragent set
    by the Torbutton version installed and used in Iceweasel.
  - Browsing (by IP) a HTTP or HTTPS server on the LAN should be possible.
  - Browsing (by IP) a FTP server on the LAN should be possible.
  - Browsing (by hostname) a FTP server on the Internet should be
    possible, and downloading a file should be possible (once
    [[!tails_todo fix Internet FTP support]] is fixed)
  - Does playing HTML5 videos work? In particular, (due to its
    popularity) do [youtube](http://www.youtube.com) videos work (once
    [[!tails_todo easier YouTube]] is fixed -- currently object
    unblocking in NoScript is required)?
  - Compare the fingerprint of Tails and the latest TBB using at least
    <https://panopticlick.eff.org/> and <http://ip-check.info/>, and
    update the
    [[fingerprint section|support/known_issues#fingerprint]] of the
    known issues page.

* Pidgin
  - (everything)

* Tor
 - firewall: is the Tor-enforcement effective?
 - firewall: is IPv6 traffic blocked?
 - is `/etc/resolv.conf` OK both before/after DHCP has been setup? it should
  *always* read `nameserver 127.0.0.1`
 - [[doc/first_steps/startup_options/bridge_mode]] should work

* Stream isolation
  - (everything)

* Claws
  - (everything)

* Whisperback
  - (everything)

* Monkeysphere
  - (everything)

* erase memory on shutdown
  - check that `udev-watchdog` is running and monitors the right
    device:
    * on USB
    * on DVD
  - After booting from DVD, remove Tails boot medium and check that
    the memory erasure process is started (`Loading new kernel`, at
    least).  The USB tests are bellow, in the USB installer section.

* Virtualization support (these have to be tested manually)

  - `modinfo vboxguest` should work when booted on the 686-pae kernel
  - test in VirtualBox

* I2P
  - (everything)

* Git
  - (everything)

* SSH
  - (everything)

* USB Installer/Upgrader
  - The installed or upgraded Tails medium shall have the "emergency
    shutdown on boot medium removal" feature working: remove Tails boot
    medium and check that the memory erasure process is started
    (`Loading new kernel`, at least).
  - Test "Clone & Install":
    * onto a USB stick that has a MBR partition table, and no
      partition at all (regression test)
    * onto a USB stick that already has an old-fashioned hybrid cat'd
      Tails on it
  - Test "Clone & Upgrade" (onto a USB install containing an older
    Tails):
    * (currently we use the same Tails version, not an older one)
    * onto a USB stick that already has a old-fashioned cat'd hybrid
      Tails on it: should warn this action is not supported, and direct
      the user to the "Clone & Install" operation mode.

* Incremental updates
  - (everything)

* Real (non-VM) hardware
  - (duh! :))

* Unsafe Web Browser
  -  On exit, check that:
    * make sure that its chroot gets properly teared down on exit (there
      should be nothing mounted inside `/var/lib/unsafe-browser`).

* Documentation
  - (everything)

* Internationalization
  - (everything)

* Misc
  - Check that all seems well during init (mostly that all services
    start without errors), and that dmesg seems ok.
  - Browsing (by hostname) a FTP server on the Internet should be
    possible using GNOME's *Connect to server* feature
    (once [[!tails_todo fix Internet FTP support]] is fixed)
  - Check that TrueCrypt is minimally usable (create a volume and unlock it).

## Puppet module to manage the tester system

The [[cucumber/install]] documentation should be turned into a Puppet
module, so that we can deploy this on lizard (and so that individual
developers can reproduce this setup in a way that's easy to keep
up-to-date with future changes).

## Support "slow" systems

In the current state of things, substantial parts of the test suite
fail unless run on powerful dedicated hardware. The most common
usecase will be to run it with nested virtualization, on
not-so-powerful hardware, so the whole test suite must be tested in
that context, and timeouts accordingly bumped as needed.

Tests are being reported on <https://pad.riseup.net/p/timeout-bumping>.

## Review all the tests and have them replace the manual ones

All the tests should be run and reviewed by someone else than
their authors.

That's not a blocker for the merge, just a blocker before we end up
saying that the test suite can replace manual testing. That can be
done on a feature-by-feature (or even scenario-by-scenario) basis.

## Move FIXME and XXX out of the code

... to this TODO list. Nobody ever fixes FIXME and XXX that are in the code.

## sdmem job waiting vs erase_memory feature

When we'll merge `feature/automated_tests/cucumber` into `stable` we'll
revert commit `255aa71` ("Make sure the memory dumping debug message
is shown cleanly") to not mess anything up for the imminent 0.17.2
release at the time. However, the `erase_memory` feature depends on
it, so we must remember to consider reverting that revert after the
release: we should first determine whether `255aa71` is safe or even
the right approach.

## Kernel Oops on real host for erase_memory feature in nested VM setup

The top excerpt of the kernel oops (which leaves the real host
completely unresponsive) is:

    BUG: unable to handle kernel paging request at ffff87ffffffffff
    IP: [<ffffffffa06ea57a>] __direct_map.isra.92+0xe3/0x1a1 [kvm]
    PDF 0
    Oops: 0000 [#1] SMP
    Modules: [snip]
    CPU 2
    Pid: 5229, comm: kvm Not tainted 3.8-trunk-amd64 #1 Debian 3.8.3-1~experimental.1 [snip]
	[snip]

It has happened every time I tried this feature, either when filling
the memory or when wiping it. I've tested all combinations of the
current Wheezy kernel (3.2.39-2) and current experimental kernel
(3.8.3-1) on both the real host and the testing VM, but to no avail.

I don't get this with a non-nested VM setup (i.e. when the automated
test suite is run from bare metal).

Also, I don't get it *as often* in the nested VM setup if I decrease
the TailsToaster RAM from 8 GiB to 5 GiB in both scenarios.

So it seems we may have an upstream linux kernel bug. Can someone else
than me (anonym) try to verify this?

## Get rid of RVM and ruby gems

Ultimately we want good enough versions of JRuby and the required ruby
gems properly packaged in Debian. Filing RFP bugs, to let people know
what we need, would be a good start.

We need serious plans to make this solution sustainable for us.

## jruby 1.7 has deprecated the C extension

This is bad news as some of the ruby gems we use depend on it:

* `ruby-libvirt` (highly critical)
* `system_timer` (not critical)

It currently means that we're stuck using `jruby 1.6.x`, which isn't
so bad in the short run, but we need a contingency plan.

> Perhaps we can allow ourselves to be stuck with 1.6.x for Wheezy
> iff. we do whatever is needed so that we can do better for Jessie,
> considering a newer OS will probably bring incompatibilities with
> "old" software.
>
> Actually, this may be needed quite soon: our current tester system
> setup needs a libvirt/qemu stack that is only available in unstable
> and experimental; we'll be unable to install new versions of these
> packages on Wheezy soon after the Jessie development cycle starts,
> so it's likely that we soon have to manage a testing environment
> based on Jessie... or maintain tons of backports.

The best would probably be if we could move to native ruby, which
would mean porting the sikuli gem somehow, maybe:
<http://rjb.rubyforge.org/>

## Use libguestfs

Currently we use an ad-hoc `dd`/`parted` combo in the storage helper
to create disk images with formatted filesystems outside of Tails to
later be used within Tails (e.g. for the untrusted partitions
feature). This limits us in many ways:

* the disk can only be backed by a `raw` image, which consumes its
  full capacity in disk space on the host unlike e.g. `qcow2` images.
* we can only create filesystems supported by `parted` which are
  very limited in number.
* acting directly on the block device (= image) if we want to use
  `LVM` or `LUKS` will probably get complicated permission-wise as the
  test suite runs as an unprivileged user. It gets impossible if we'd
  use image types other than `raw` (unless something like `qemu-nbd`
  is used to create virtual block devices of the images, which again
  will require privileges).

At other places (e.g. the USB install feature) we use `udisks` from
inside Tails to query disk information, but this should preferably be
made from the "outside" (i.e. no inside Tails, which is what we test).

[libguestfs](http://libguestfs.org/) supports all of the above and is
part of the libvirt "family" of tools (and deal with permissions in
the same, sane way), and it has ruby bindings. It seems like a perfect
fit.

## Remove race condition-prone sleep():s

A `sleep` that's good enough on your hardware might not be good enough
on mine. We need to, whenever possible, use reliable ways to detect
the state we are waiting for instead of `sleep`:ing some fixed time
and hoping we've reached that state by then.

## Retry when Tor fails

Some scenarios uses the live Tor network, which is not entirely
reliable, so we may get failing scenarios when in fact we just
happened to pick a Tor circuit that's too slow, or even one that's
broken but Tor fails to remedy the situation. For this reason we may
want to tag such scenarios with `@uses_tor`, and create an
`Around('@uses_tor')` hook which re-tries those scenarios some number
of times before actually failing it.

## SATA drives don't work?

When creating a (`raw`) disk via the storage helper, and then plugging
it to a Tails instance as SATA drive, GNOME will report that the drive
is failing when inside Tails, and indeed several SMART tests fail.

> What's the practical downside of this? In other words, why do
> we care? --intrigeri

## Background snapshots

While these are invaluable for speeding up the test suite and not
hammering the Tor authorities excessively with complete bootstraps,
they do introduce some ugly code overhead and confusion:

* There's the need of the "I save the state ..." step at the end of
  the Background, which is pretty hackish.
* Each "skippable" step needs an `next if ...` line around the top of
  the step.
* In the previous point I say "around" the top, because sometimes
  input from a step are to be saved in some global variable to be
  accessible for subsequent steps, and then those assignments should
  happen before the `next if ...`. It's pretty confusing.

It'd be great if we could tag steps `@skippable` and skip them when
appropriate using something like an `AroundStep('@skippable')` hook,
but vanilla cucumber supports neither tagging of steps not such a hook
([cucumber-cpp](https://www.ohloh.net/p/cucumber-cpp/) does,
though). OTOH, with all that we'd be unable to save any input from the
skipped steps, which probably would require some interesting
workarounds (maybe using real `$global` variables instead of `@class`
variables will do?).

So the question is if we really can improve the situation. An
`AfterBackground` hook would at least be nice for killing the "I save
the state ..." step.

## Media removal doesn't register (for udev) in guest

While it's possible to tell libvirt to forcefully remove both DVD and
USB media, it doesn't give emit the signal (or whatever) that our udev
watchdog wants. The media just gets inaccessible with lots of IO
errors going on. This prevents implementation of the tests:

* erase memory on shutdown
  - After booting from DVD, remove Tails boot medium and check that
    the memory erasure process is started (`Loading new kernel`, at
    least).  The USB tests are bellow, in the USB installer section.

* USB Installer/Upgrader
  - The installed or upgraded Tails medium shall have the "emergency
    shutdown on boot medium removal" feature working: remove Tails
    boot medium and check that the memory erasure process is started
    (`Loading new kernel`, at least).

## Remote shell

### pgrep -f detects itself

When running `@vm.execute("pgrep -f $something")` it currently the
case that `pgrep` lists its own pid (and hence never fails, which
could be of great importance), unlike when you run it natively, and
unlike "The running pgrep or pkill process will never report itself as
a match." in `pgrep(1)`.

The practical problem is the (potentially serious) surprise one can be
hit by when writing a step definition.

Why is that happening? Are other tools misbehaving?

## usb_install feature

### Upgrade should be from an older Tails

Currently we upgrade Tails from the same version, which isn't what's
said in the manual test suite.

### Disabled scenario: "the boot device has safe access rights"

It turns out our fix for Debian bug #645466 (see
`config/chroot_local_includes/lib/live/config/998-permissions` and the
bug: [[bugs/writable_system_disk:_belongs_to_floppy_group]] (now
reopened)) is not working any more. the boot device (including boot
partition and any persistent partition) is owned by group `floppy`
which the `amnesia` user is a member of, enabling it full write
permissions to it. Is udev doing this at a later stage now?

## GnuPG encryption feature

All scenarios fail for intrigeri: for some reason "encrypt with
passphrase" is selected even in the scenario that's supposed to hit
"k" to select "encrypt with pubkey".

## unsafe browser feature

The unsafe browser should be started from the applications menu,
or at least in exactly the same way as it is run by the `.desktop`
(that is, `sudo unsafe-browser`), possibly by extracting that
command-line from the `.desktop`.

## apt feature

### fails

    Scenario: Install packages using synaptic                              # features/cucumber/apt/apt.feature:29
      When I run "gksu synaptic"                                           # features/cucumber/step_definitions/common_steps.rb:347
      And I enter the sudo password in the PolicyKit prompt                # features/cucumber/step_definitions/common_steps.rb:353
      And I update APT using synaptic                                      # features/cucumber/apt/step_definitions/apt.rb:39
        The image 'SynapticReloadPrompt.png' did not match in this region. (Sikuli::ImageNotFound)
        ./features/cucumber/apt/step_definitions/apt.rb:46:in `(root)':in `/^I update APT using synaptic$/'
        features/cucumber/apt/apt.feature:32:in `And I update APT using synaptic'

### should run synaptic in a more realistic way

Synaptic should be started from the applications menu, or at least we
should make sure it's started in exactly the same way as it is run by
the `.desktop` by extracting that command-line from the `.desktop`
(e.g. on Wheezy, this will be `synaptic-pkexec`).

### should test Tails APT repository sources

* Make sure the Tails repository suite matching the release tag is in
  APT sources.
* Make sure the Tails repository unversioned suites (e.g. `testing`,
  `stable` and `devel`) are *not* in APT sources.

## root access control feature

We're testing "the live user should be able to get administrative
privileges through PolicyKit" by... running `gksu synaptic`. This is
wrong, as being a sudoer is orthogonal to being an administrator from
the PolicyKit point-of-view (IIRC on Debian PolicyKit is configured so
that members of the `sudo` group are PolicyKit admins, which can be
confusing, but still, one cannot test PolicyKit privileges by running
sudo).

`pkexec` to run the action, after using `pkcheck` to verify that the
action requires to be an admin, perhaps?

## usb install feature

This scenario fails:

    Scenario: Writing files to a read/write-enabled persistent partition # features/cucumber/usb/usb_install.feature:70
    Given a computer                                                   # features/cucumber/step_definitions/common_steps.rb:63
    And the computer is setup up to boot from USB drive "A"            # features/cucumber/usb/step_definitions/usb.rb:257
    And the network is unplugged                                       # features/cucumber/step_definitions/common_steps.rb:102
    When I start the computer                                          # features/cucumber/step_definitions/common_steps.rb:120
    And the computer boots Tails                                       # features/cucumber/step_definitions/common_steps.rb:146
    And Tails is running from USB drive "A"                            # features/cucumber/usb/step_definitions/usb.rb:284
    And the boot device has safe access rights                         # features/cucumber/usb/step_definitions/usb.rb:295
      This check is temporarily disabled since it currently always fails
    And I enable persistence with password "asdf"                      # features/cucumber/usb/step_definitions/usb.rb:216
    And I log in to a new session                                      # features/cucumber/step_definitions/common_steps.rb:159
    And persistence has been enabled                                   # features/cucumber/usb/step_definitions/usb.rb:245
    And I write some files expected to persist                         # features/cucumber/usb/step_definitions/usb.rb:333
    And I shutdown Tails                                               # features/cucumber/step_definitions/common_steps.rb:376
      The image 'TailsEmergencyShutdownButton.png' did not match in this region. (Sikuli::ImageNotFound)
      ./features/cucumber/support/helpers/sikuli_helper.rb:31:in `wait_and_click'
      ./features/cucumber/step_definitions/common_steps.rb:379:in `(root)':in `/^I shutdown Tails$/'
      features/cucumber/usb/usb_install.feature:82:in `And I shutdown Tails'

Then all following scenarios fail with `Cannot allocate memory`.

## "the shipped Tails signing key is not outdated" scenario

Why not test "old w.r.t. the one we fetch from Tails' website", but
what we mainly need to test here (and the reason why this test was
added to begin with) is that the key (nor any of its subkeys) has
not expired, and won't expire any time soon.

## MAT check fails

... presumably due to some race condition that might simply be avoided
if moved to a dedicated feature:

    And I setup a filesystem share containing a sample PDF               # features/cucumber/misc_tests/step_definitions/checks.rb:103
    And I start the computer                                             # features/cucumber/step_definitions/common_steps.rb:120
      Call to virDomainCreateWithFlags failed: Unable to read from monitor: Connection reset by peer (Libvirt::Error)
      ./features/cucumber/support/helpers/vm_helper.rb:359:in `start'
      ./features/cucumber/step_definitions/common_steps.rb:124:in `(root)':in `/^I start the computer$/'
      features/cucumber/misc_tests/checks.feature:44:in `And I start the computer'

## firewall helper

* Remove the link-local multicast from the whitelist. First, it should
  not be needed anymore, and second, we should never cheat to have
  tests that fail due to bugs pass.
* Don't ignore non-IP packets.

## add anti-tests

... that is, tests that verify that the test suite would properly
detect failure. Our manual erase memory test procedure is a good
example thereof: it checks that we *can* find the pattern in memory if
we skip the memory wipe step on purpose.

Especially for complex stuff like the firewall helper classes, that
are hard to review for non-Ruby-native-speakers, I would feel much
more comfortable if we had a test that wilfully breaks and bypasses
the firewall, and checks that the helper code indeed detects the leak;
it would be good to check non-trivial kind of leaks too, e.g. non-IP
packets, that are currently ignored by the test suite if I understand
it correctly.

Another anti-test that would be useful would be, in the
`untrusted_partitions` feature, to check that the live system stored
on hard drive boots fine if no Tails ISO is provided.

## move configuration out of classes

E.g. `tor_authorities` should probably be set somewhere else than
in .

## design documentation

Relevant design and implementation notes that are currently spread on
this page and on [[todo/automated_builds_and_tests]] should be moved
to a sub-page of contribute/design.

### Remote shell

This started out as a hack, and while it has evolved it largely
remains so. A proper, reliable, established replacement would be
welcome, but seems unlikely given the requirements:

Requirements on the host (the remote shell client):

* can execute a command with blocking until command completion on the
  server, and get back return code, stdout and stderr separately.
* can spawn a command without blocking (except an ACK that the server
  has run the command, perhaps).
* usable by an unprivileged user

Requirements on the guest (the remote shell server):

* has to work without a network connection.
* should interfere minimally with the surrounding system (e.g. no
  firewall exceptions; actually we don't want any network traffic at
  all from it, but this kind of follows from the previous requirement
  any way)

### Remote shell instability

Although very rare, the remote shell can get into a state where it
stops responding, resulting in the test suite waiting for a response
forever. The reason for this has proved hard to determine, but it
seems to basically only happen for the very first interaction with it.

I think it has to do with the fact that its transport is TCP on the
host bridged to a serial device on the guest (see `<serial
type='tcp'>` in Libvirt domain XML format). Perhaps the TCP state vs
the guest's serial port's state gets out-of-sync if the TCP packet
times out before the serial port is up and running?

### Remote shell: minor groups not set

If we run `@vm.execute("groups", "amnesia")` it'll only list
membership in the major group, i.e. `amnesia`.

Ideally, as long as we don't use the remote shell to test actions that
a real user could perform, and only use it to check results and
prepare stuff, this should not be a practical problem.

However, we have at least one exception (apt-get update / install)
that uses the remote shell to emulate user action, and it would be
a pain to rewrite using Sikuli, so we'd rather keep this exception.

Then, we have to document this remote shell shortcoming in the
upcoming "how to write tests" documentation, and forget about minor
groups. We also have to document that this remote shell should be used
as little as possible to emulate user actions.

### USB scenario dependencies

An issue with this feature is that scenarios depend on earlier
scenarios. For instance, "Booting Tails from USB drive ..."  depends
on "Installing Tails to a prestine USB drive" or one of the, Upgrading
a Tails USB drive from ..." which in turn depend on "Installing
...". This is not goo practice, but the alternative would be gigantic
scenarios that test several logically different scenarios in turn,
some of the above quoted scenarios concatenated.

### Host-to-guest filesystem share incompatibility with snapshots

Filesystem shares cannot (due to QEMU limitations) be added to an
active VM, and cannot (due to QEMU limitations) be active
(i.e. mounted) during a snapshot save. Hence unmounting before save
and remounting after restore them seems like a good idea.

However, the `9p*` modules seem to get into a broken state during a
save + restore (the "tags" used as `mount` source cannot be found), so
unloading before save and reload after restore comes to mind. But
loading `9pnet_virtio` fails after a restore with `probe of virtio2
failed with error -2` (in `dmesg`) and the shares remain unmountable.

This has to be investigated further, and possible upstream bugs
should be reported.
