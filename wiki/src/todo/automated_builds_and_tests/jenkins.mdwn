Miscellaneous
-------------

- [Jenkins Best
  Practices](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+Best+Practices)
- [plugins](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Plugins)
  * [Git plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Git+Plugin)
  * [Copy Artifact
    plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Copy+Artifact+Plugin)
    can be used to run a test job against the result of a build job,
    e.g. for Debian packages (think Lintian) or Tails ISO images; see
    [grml's setup
    documentation](http://jenkins-debian-glue.org/getting_started/manual/)
    that uses it.
- the [jenkins](http://jujucharms.com/charms/precise/jenkins) and
  [jenkins-slave](http://jujucharms.com/charms/precise/jenkins-slave)
  JuJu charms may be good sources of inspiration for deployment
- [[!cpan Net-Jenkins]] (not in Debian) allows to interact with
  a Jenkins server: create and start jobs, get information about
  builds etc.

Jobs management
---------------

- [Job builder](http://ci.openstack.org/jenkins-job-builder/) provides
  one-way (Git to Jenkins) jobs synchronization; it's in Debian sid.
  * [configuration documentation](http://ci.openstack.org/jenkins-job-builder/configuration.html)
  * Debian uses it in their `update_jdn.sh`: it runs `jenkins-jobs
    update $config` after importing updated YAML job config files
    from Git.
  * Tor [use
    it](https://gitweb.torproject.org/project/jenkins/jobs.git/tree) too.
- jenkins.debian.net uses the [SCM
  Sync](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/SCM+Sync+configuration+plugin)
  plugin, that apparently handles committing to the VCS on
  configuration changes done in the web interface, and maybe more.
- [jenkins-yaml](https://github.com/varnish/jenkins-yaml) might make
  it easy to generate a large number of similar Jenkins jobs, e.g.
  one per branch
- [jenkins_jobs puppet module](http://tradeshift.com/blog/tstech-managing-jenkins-job-configurations-by-puppet/)

Web setup
---------

### Visible read-only on the web

We'd like our Jenkins instance to be visible read-only on the web.
We'd rather not rely on Jenkins authentication / authorization to
enforce this read-only policy. We'd rather see the frontend reverse
proxy take care of this.

The
[`getUnprotectedRootActions()`](http://javadoc.jenkins-ci.org/jenkins/model/Jenkins.html#getUnprotectedRootActions())
method should return the list of URL prefixes that we want to allow.
And we could forbid anything else.

The [Reverse Proxy
Auth](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Reverse+Proxy+Auth+Plugin)
Jenkins plugin can be useful to display [an example
usage](https://github.com/jenkinsci/reverse-proxy-auth-plugin/commit/72567a974960be2363107614ba3f705ec6e9b695)
of this method.

### Miscellaneous

Notifications
-------------

- [IRC plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/IRC+Plugin),
  but I'm told that the jenkins email notifications are way nicer
  than what this plugin can do, so see [a better way to do
  it](http://jenkins.debian.net/userContent/setup.html#_installing_kgb_client)
- [[!cpan Jenkins-NotificationListener]] is a server that listens to
  messages from Jenkins [Notification
  plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Notification+Plugin).

How others use Jenkins
----------------------

-  jenkins.debian.net's:
   * [setup documentation](http://jenkins.debian.net/userContent/setup.html)
   * configuration: `git://git.debian.org/git/users/holger/jenkins.debian.net.git`
- [Tor's jobs](https://gitweb.torproject.org/project/jenkins/jobs.git/blob/HEAD:/jobs.yaml)
- [Ubuntu QA Jenkins instance](https://jenkins.qa.ubuntu.com/)
- grml's Michael Prokop talks about autotesting in KVM during his
  [talk at DebConf
  10](http://penta.debconf.org/dc10_schedule/events/547.en.html);
  they use Jenkins:
  * [Jenkins instance](http://jenkins.grml.org/)
  * [unittests](https://github.com/grml/grml-unittests)
  * [debian-glue Jenkins plugin](https://github.com/mika/jenkins-debian-glue)
  * [kantan](https://github.com/mika/kantan): simple test suite for
    autotesting using Grml and KVM
  * [Jenkins server setup documentation](https://github.com/grml/grml-server-setup/blob/master/jenkins.asciidoc)
- [jenkinstool](http://git.gitano.org.uk/personal/liw/jenkinstool.git/)
  has the tools Lars Wirzenius uses to manage his CI (Python projects
  test suite, Debian packages, importing into reprepro, VM setup of
  all needed stuff); the whole thing is very ad-hoc but many bits
  could be used as inspiration sources.

Jenkins for Perl projects
-------------------------

* [a collection of links](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Perl+Projects)
  on the Jenkins wiki
* an overview of the available tools: [[!cpan Task::Jenkins]]
* [a tutorial](https://logiclab.jira.com/wiki/display/OPEN/Continuous+Integration)
* [another tutorial](http://alexandre-masselot.blogspot.com/2011/12/perl-hudson-continuous-testing.html)
* use [[!cpan TAP::Formatter::JUnit]] (in Wheezy) rather than the Jenkins TAP plugin
* use `prove --timer` to know how long each test takes
