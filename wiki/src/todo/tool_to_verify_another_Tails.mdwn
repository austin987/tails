Isn't this already included? Even has a nifty GUI...

If you change the tails*.iso.pgp signiture file's extension from .pgp to .sig or .sign then nautilus' context menu will include to "Open with verify signiture". The TAILS signing key is already on the keyring so it all works perfectly.

Perhaps all this needs is filling a bug to either change the extension on the signiture files or add the appropriate MIME type for .pgp files?
