In Nautilus, when the mouse pointer is hold over an audio file, the file
starts being played as part of nautilus preview of audio files
capability.

The gain of having the preview enabled doesn't compensate the possible
unexpected behavior and unwanted attention this might create.

So we should deactivate that preview feature. Nautilus -> Edit ->
Preferences -> Preview -> Audio Files should be set to "Never" instead
of "Only local files".

> It's handle by gconf with the key `/apps/nautilus/preferences/preview_sound`  
> In one command line:  
> `gconftool-2 --type string --set /apps/nautilus/preferences/preview_sound never`
