Diskcryptor seems to be an efficient open-source alternative to
truecrypt. http://www.diskcryptor.net/wiki/Main_Page/en

I haven't tested it and my crypt knowledge is very low, but i think
it's worth a lookout...

Another alternative might be RealCrypt, Fedora has also banned
Truecrypt from its distribution due to the licensing and has forked it
to [RealCrypt](http://rpmfusion.org/Package/realcrypt).

Tails is based on Debian so it probably can't be done, I don't know,
just saying because you never know.
