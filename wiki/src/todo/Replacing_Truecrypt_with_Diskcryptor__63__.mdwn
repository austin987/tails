Diskcryptor seems to be an efficient open-source alternative to truecrypt.

I haven't tested it and my crypt knowledge is very low, but i think it's worth a lookout...

Another alternative might be RealCrypt, Fedora has also banned Truecrypt from its distribution due to the licensing and has forked it to RealCrypt.

Tails is based on Debian so it probably can't be done, I don't know, just saying because you never know.
