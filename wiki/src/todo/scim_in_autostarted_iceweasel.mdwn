1. Boot up a Tails 0.14 system
2. Use the language choser to select Japanese and login
3. Wait for IceWeasel to launch automatically
4. Try activating SCIM/Anthy in IceWeasel by pressing CTRL+SPACE

=> SCIM/Anthy does not activate.

OTOH, this works fine with IceWeasel run from the menu or quick
launch icon.

Quick tests indicate that exporting the desktop session's `XMODIFIERS`
environment variable before running iceweasel as root fixes this bug,
so we would have to add a xdm autostart script to save the content of
this variable, and add logics to
`config/chroot_local-includes/etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/60-iceweasel.sh`
so that it reads and re-exports the saved information.

While we're at it, exporting `GTK_IM_MODULE` and `QT_IM_MODULE` too
might help fix similar, not discovered yet, issues.

> Implemented in `bugfix/scim-in-autostarted-iceweasel`,
> merged into devel, [[!taglink todo/done]] in Tails 0.16.
