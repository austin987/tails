Hello,

a Tails user just reported it on IRC and I report it here as I had the same thought too for a while.

Possibly it's better to mute the audio or set the volume to zero at boot time because system sounds and accidentially run audio/video files could raise suspicion.

Maybe it's better to let the user do the 2 clicks to enable it, just to be on the safe side.

Inspiration sources
===================

* The "Small patch to mute sound on boot time" thread on
  tails-dev; last patch [[attached
  here|mute_audio_output/0001-Small-patch-to-mute-the-sound-card-Master-channel-on.patch]].
* Debian's `alsa-utils` initscript and its `/usr/share/alsa/utils.sh`
  library deals with channel levels in a way that supports many
  specific tricks needed by various hardware.
* Liberte Linux' `src/usr/local/bin/reset-mixer` (which
  seems to only mute the first sound-card, and supports a limited set
  of controls, and therefore a limited set of hardware).

Implementation issues
=====================

What channel(s) shall be muted?
-------------------------------

According to the [archlinux
documentation](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Advanced_Linux_Sound_Architecture#Unmuting_the_channels),
"ALSA installs with all channels muted by default"; indeed, most of
the work done by the `alsa-utils` initscript in Debian is merely to
unmute many channels and toggle many controls.

If we mute all possible channels, most users won't know what
hardware-dependent list of channels they must unmute and increase
level in order to get sound output.

So we may want to mute only the `Master` channel. However, this would
only be a partial implementation of the stated goal: it seems there
are ALSA drivers that don't expose a `Master` channel, e.g. see [this
bug report](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=594936).
