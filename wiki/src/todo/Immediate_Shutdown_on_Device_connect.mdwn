Threat: DMA-capable devices to retrieve memory of a running (and probably locked) Tails machine. This is especially important considering the proposal to add a server-mode to Tails for offering Tor Hidden Services from a dedicated machine. Another threat are Stuxnet-like bugs that allow USB and other devices to exploit the host operating system and/or software running on it and enable the execution of code on the device (see Stuxnet and WIndows LNK vulnerability for Windows and http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2010-2640 for Linux).

Scenario: Dedicated Tor Hidden Service server with an encrypted harddisk serves content, and someone wants to extract the memory to compromise the machine or gain access of the cryptographic keys from memory. The adversary hotplugs a DMA capable PCI/PCIx card and reads the memory. Another scenario is a machine running Tails that is removed from the control of the user, e.g. by force against the user or snatching the machine.

Defense: Disable any hotplugging of DMA capable devices, and devices in general to an already running system.

Proposal: Expand the immediate-shutdown-behaviour of the udev-watchdog to any device that gets connected to the computer. Enable this behaviour by offering an optional boot parameter. Once the system is running, any hardware added to it causes an immediate shutdown and execution of the memory wipe.
