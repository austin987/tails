What kind of fingerprinting resistance a system like Tails can
reasonably pretend to, at the network scale? How safe is the current
"Tor, nothing else, no NTP"? Shall we emmit a fake NTP query (when
others that usually do) and drop it, as suggested by adrelanos?

See "secure and simple network time (hack)" thread or tor-talk, around
July 2012.

Also see discussion about fingerprinting on [[contribute/design/Time_syncing]].

**Next thing to do**: update this page with the thinking and decisions
we've made at the 2012 Tails summit [anonym].
