Rationale
=========

An automated build and test environment would be pretty useful to
ensure a few facts:

- new code does not break anything
- new build tools (`live-build`) and included software
  (`live-config`, `live-boot`) don't break anything
- the quality of our releases is good enough
- every developer can comfortably test his/her code without owning
  modern high-end hardware (8GB RAM is needed in order to build
  a Tails image in tmpfs).

Left to do
==========

1. notification (sent to whom?) when a build fails (repeatedly?)
2. allow developers to have their personal branch(es?) autobuilt as
   well => help developers test their code *before* pushing it to the
   `devel` branch
3. allow developers to test an autobuilt image in a VM over VNC or
   similar
4. automated runtime tests

Already done
============

The `devel` and `testing` branches are automatically built in a
[buildbot](http://buildbot.net/) instance.
