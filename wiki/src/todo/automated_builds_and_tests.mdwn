[[!toc levels=2]]

Rationale
=========

An automated build and test environment would be pretty useful to
ensure a few facts:

- new code does not break anything
- new build tools (`live-build`) and included software
  (`live-config`, `live-boot`) don't break anything
- updates pushed to the APT repositories we don't control (e.g. Debian's)
  don't break anything
- the quality of our releases is good enough
- power users get to test early images built from feature branches,
  or from `experimental`
- we can ask bug reporters to test an image built from a bugfix
  branch, and see if it fixes their problem

What we have
============

An unconfigured Jenkins instance installed on lizard.

Roadmap
=======

0. See if/how jenkins.debian.net, grml, Ubuntu and others keep their
   job config in Git. [[!tag todo/research]]
   - for Debian, their `update_jdn.sh` uses [Jenkins Jobs
     Builder](http://ci.openstack.org/jenkins-job-builder/): it runs
     `jenkins-jobs update $config` after importing updated YAML job
     config files from Git
   - jenkins.debian.net uses the [SCM
     Sync](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/SCM+Sync+configuration+plugin)
     plugin, that apparently handles committing to the VCS on
     configuration changes done in the web interface, and maybe more
   - there's also the [jenkins_jobs puppet
     module](http://tradeshift.com/blog/tstech-managing-jenkins-job-configurations-by-puppet/)
0. See if/how people use Puppet to deploy Jenkins jobs. [[!tag todo/research]]
0. Setup a few basic Jenkins jobs, e.g. simply run cucumber in Tails
   source tree after every commit in `stable`, `testing`, `devel`,
   `experimental`, `feature/*` and `bugfix/*` [[!tag todo/sysadmin]]
0. Setup Jenkins authentication with the [standard security
   setup](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Standard+Security+Setup)
   [[!tag todo/sysadmin]]
0. Setup a web frontend so that the Jenkins web interface is shown to
   the world [[!tag todo/sysadmin]]
0. Setup email notifications
0. Add more Jenkins jobs such as:
   - run our various [[custom programs|contribute/git]]' test suite
     (see the section about Perl projects on [[automated builds and tests]])
     and build Debian packages for them
   - check PO files [[validity with
     i18nspector|contribute/l10n_tricks]]
   - automated ISO builds
   - automated test suite
0. Setup IRC notifications (see [[resources|automated builds and tests/jenkins]])

What we need
============

Automated builds
----------------

Our [[Vagrant build environment|contribute/build]] can be used to automate builds
(point "build in a throw-away VM" of the above todo list).

Automated tests
---------------

This is being implemented: see the `feature/automated_tests/cucumber`
Git branch and [[the dedicated
sub-ticket|automated_builds_and_tests/cucumber]].

Infrastructure
--------------

Ideally, every automatically built ISO should be scrutinized by automated
tests. Putting both process on the same physical machine (while using
virtualization to separate concerns) will reduce the hosting and bandwidth cost.
Fresh image can be tested without having to be transferred.

In order to be able to build Tails in memory (which greatly speeds up builds)
and to properly test HIGHMEM memory wipes, the test server should have at
least 32 GB. Using KVM inside a KVM
virtual machine is supported by the "nested KVM" feature available since
Linux 3.1. VirtualBox (Vagrant) in KVM is not supported as of March 2013.

We could set a threshold of tests that have to be successful before publishing
one daily build image. This would prevent too-broken images to spread out and
potentially harm users.

The setup of the automated build and test server should be moved or continued
using open Puppet modules.

What we had
===========

This documents the obsolete buildbot setup that was never lead to an
actually useful state.

## Automated builds

A buildbot instance automatically builds the `experimental`, `devel`,
`testing` and `stable` branches. No build result is currently
published due to bandwidth constrains, to there is no way for
developers or users to download the results yet.

## Setup

Our buildbot's instance runs inside a KVM guest managed by libvirt.

## What was left to do

0. Have the build failure notification sent to someone who wants to
   work on this.
1. Custom notifications when a build fails: the one currently sent
   lacks some useful information.
2. Request a mailing-list where buildbot would send its build
   failure reports.
3. Move to a "build in a throw-away VM" approach, so that a given
   build cannot taint future ones.
4. Build *all* `feature/*` and `bugfix/*` branches.

Resources
=========

## Jenkins

See [[our wiki page|automated builds and tests/jenkins]] dedicated to Jenkins.

## Buildbot

Buildbot can be seen as a [framework](http://jacobian.org/writing/buildbot/) to
deploy continuous integration. It has no real configuration file, but
what deserves this role is a file that can be thought programatically.
Thus it provide a very flexible environment that can be customize for
most projects needs.

Some interesting pages, might be worth reading for people willing to
play with buildbot and understand its logic :

* [Chromium's buildbot config](http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/tools/build),
  which is the one driving their [builbot instance](http://build.chromium.org/)
* [Buildbot's documentation](http://buildbot.net/buildbot/docs/latest/)

## Testing tools and examples

- <http://live.debian.net/gitweb/?p=live-autobuild.git> is currently
  used to build "official" daily Debian Live images
- [buildbot](http://buildbot.net) : a continous integration bot, able to
  communicate over mail or IRC. Used by many projects.
- Tor project's [buildbot configuration](https://gitweb.torproject.org/admin/buildbot-conf.git)
- Martin Pitt
  [announces](http://www.piware.de/2013/02/umockdev-record-and-mock-hardware-for-debugging-and-testing/)
  umockdev ([source code](https://github.com/martinpitt/umockdev)),
  a set of tools to record and mock hardware for debugging and testing
