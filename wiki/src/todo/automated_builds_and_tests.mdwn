An automated build and test environment would be pretty useful to
ensure a few facts:

- new code does not break anything
- new build tools (`live-build``) and included software
  (`live-config`, `live-boot`) don't break anything
- the quality of our releases is good enough
- every developer can comfortably test his/her code without owning
  modern high-end hardware (8GB RAM is needed in order to build
  a T(A)ILS image in tmpfs).
