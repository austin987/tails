[[!tag todo/code]]

[[!toc levels=2]]

Rationale
=========

An automated build and test environment would be pretty useful to
ensure a few facts:

- new code does not break anything
- new build tools (`live-build`) and included software
  (`live-config`, `live-boot`) don't break anything
- the quality of our releases is good enough
- power users get to test early images built from feature branches,
  or from `experimental`
- we can ask bug reporters to test an image built from a bugfix
  branch, and see if it fixes their problem

What we have
============

An unconfigured Jenkins instance installed on lizard.

Roadmap
=======

0. See if/how jenkins.debian.net, grml, Ubuntu and others keep their
   job config in Git. [[!tag todo/research]]
0. See if/how people use Puppet to deploy Jenkins jobs. [[!tag todo/research]]
0. Setup a few basic Jenkins jobs, e.g. simply run cucumber in Tails
   source tree after every commit in `stable`, `testing`, `devel`,
   `experimental`, `feature/*` and `bugfix/*` [[!tag todo/sysadmin]]
0. Setup Jenkins authentication with the [standard security
   setup](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Standard+Security+Setup)
   [[!tag todo/sysadmin]]
0. Setup a web frontend so that the Jenkins web interface is shown to
   the world [[!tag todo/sysadmin]]
0. Add more Jenkins jobs such as:
   - build Debian packages for our various [[custom bundled
     programs|contribute/git]]
   - check PO files [[validity with
     i18nspector|contribute/l10n_tricks]]
   - run our various custom programs' test suite (see the doc
     [specific to Perl
     projects]https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Perl+Projects))
   - automated ISO builds
   - automated test suite

What we need
============

Builds
------

Our [[Vagrant build environment|contribute/build]] can be used to automate builds
(point "build in a throw-away VM" of the above todo list).

Tests
-----

Having test automation for every build, implementing programmatically
at least the [[release tests|contribute/release_process/test]] we
currently run by hand at release time... and maybe more. One more step
towards Continuous Integration.

Jenkins should also be able to drive the automated test phase. One way
would be to have the slave talking to the libvirt daemon running on the
host system, asking to start the last built iso, then run tests on it.
This has some requirements to work though:

* Tests have to be in the Tails sources, so that the slave is able to
  run them. The tools used for testing may be installed inside the
  Live system being tested at runtime.
* There might be some cases where the tests have to be started
  from inside the tested Tails system. In this case, the easiest way
  might be to have this tests included in the Tails release. That might
  be an interesting idea for other moments, like for bug reporting or to
  provide users a way to test a functionnality themselves. But then,
  ways have to be defined for the slave to start the tests inside the
  remote VM and get their return codes (maybe sikuli might be of some
  help here?) so that it can reports which one failed.

In order to properly test features like USB installer, the
virtualization environment must support USB 2.0. That pretty much
limits the choice to recent QEMU or KVM versions.

A first POC has been created in the `feature/automated_tests/cucumber` git
branch. Read [[the dedicated documentation|automated_builds_and_tests/cucumber]]
for more informations.

Infrastructure
--------------

Ideally, every automatically built ISO should be scrutinized by automated
tests. Putting both process on the same physical machine (while using
virtualization to separate concerns) will reduce the hosting and bandwidth cost.
Fresh image can be tested without having to be transferred.

In order to be able to build Tails in memory (which greatly speeds up builds)
and to properly test HIGHMEM memory wipes, the test server should have at
least 32 GB. Using Vagrant (hence VirtualBox) or libvirt/KVM inside a KVM
virtual machine is supported by the "nested KVM" feature available since
Linux 3.1.

We could set a threshold of tests that have to be successful before publishing
one daily build image. This would prevent too-broken images to spread out and
potentially harm users.

The setup of the automated build and test server should be moved or continued
using open Puppet modules.

What we had
===========

This documents the obsolete buildbot setup that was never lead to an
actually useful state.

## Automated builds

A buildbot instance automatically builds the `experimental`, `devel`,
`testing` and `stable` branches. No build result is currently
published due to bandwidth constrains, to there is no way for
developers or users to download the results yet.

## Setup

Our buildbot's instance runs inside a KVM guest managed by libvirt.

## What was left to do

0. Have the build failure notification sent to someone who wants to
   work on this.
1. Custom notifications when a build fails: the one currently sent
   lacks some useful information.
2. Request a mailing-list where buildbot would send its build
   failure reports.
3. Move to a "build in a throw-away VM" approach, so that a given
   build cannot taint future ones.
4. Build *all* `feature/*` and `bugfix/*` branches.

Resources
=========

## Jenkins

See [[our wiki page|automated builds and tests/jenkins]] dedicated to Jenkins.

## Buildbot

Buildbot can be seen as a [framework](http://jacobian.org/writing/buildbot/) to
deploy continuous integration. It has no real configuration file, but
what deserves this role is a file that can be thought programatically.
Thus it provide a very flexible environment that can be customize for
most projects needs.

Some interesting pages, might be worth reading for people willing to
play with buildbot and understand its logic :

* [Chromium's buildbot config](http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/tools/build),
  which is the one driving their [builbot instance](http://build.chromium.org/)
* [Buildbot's documentation](http://buildbot.net/buildbot/docs/latest/)

  the bootloader and booting the kernel up to testing applications
  like Firefox and LibreOffice":
  [announce](http://news.opensuse.org/2011/10/11/opensuse-announces-first-public-release-of-openqa/).
  It's a test-scheduler and web-frontend for openSUSE using
  [OS-autoinst](http://www.os-autoinst.org/), that sends key presses
  and takes snapshots over the KVM `-monitor` interface; [test
  modules](http://os-autoinst.org/testmodules.html) are written in
  Perl, can move mouse, send key presses, wait for images to appear,
  verify checksums of screenshots. See [example of
  results](http://openqa.opensuse.org/results/).
