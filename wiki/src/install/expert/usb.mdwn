Verify the Tails signing key
============================

<div class="tip">

<p>If you already certified the Tails signing key with your own key, you
can skip this step and start [[downloading and verifying the ISO
image|usb#download]].</p>

</div>

In this step, you will download and verify the <em>Tails signing
key</em> which is the OpenPGP key that is used to cryptographically sign
the Tails ISO image.

<div class="note">

<p>To follow these instructions you need to have your own OpenPGP
key.</p>

<p>To learn how to create yourself an OpenPGP key, see
<a href="https://help.riseup.net/en/security/message-security/openpgp/gpg-keys">Managing
OpenPGP Keys</a> by <em>Riseup</em>.</p>

</div>

1. Import the Tails signing key in your <span class="application">GnuPG</span> keyring:

       wget https://tails.boum.org/tails-signing.key

       gpg --import < tails-signing.key

1. Install the Debian keyring. It contains the OpenPGP keys of all Debian developers:

       sudo apt-get install debian-keyring/jessie

1. Import the OpenPGP key of [[!wikipedia Stefano_Zacchiroli]], a former
   Debian Project Leader, from the Debian keyring into your keyring:

       gpg --keyring=/usr/share/keyrings/debian-keyring.gpg --export zack@upsilon.cc | gpg --import

1. Verify the certifications made on the Tails signing key:

       gpg --keyid-format 0xlong --check-sigs A490D0F4D311A4153E2BB7CADBB802B258ACD84F

   In the output of this command, look for the following line:

       sig! 0x9C31503C6D866396 2015-02-03  Stefano Zacchiroli <zack@upsilon.cc>

   Here, <code>sig!</code>, with an exclamation mark, means that Stefano
   Zacchiroli verified and certified the Tails signing key with his key.

   It is also possible to verify the certifications made by other
   people. Their name and email address appear in the list of
   certification if you have their key in your keyring.

   <div class="caution">
   <p>If the verification of the certification failed, then you might
   have downloaded a malicious version of the Tails signing key or our
   instructions might be outdated.
   Please [[get in touch with us|support/talk]].</p>
   </div>

1. Certify the Tails signing key with your own key:

       gpg --sign-key A490D0F4D311A4153E2BB7CADBB802B258ACD84F

   <div class="note">
   <p>It is possible to publish your certification of the Tails signing
   key on the public key servers. Doing so allows people who verified
   your key to verify your certification and, as a consequence, build
   more trust in the Tails signing key. To publish your certification,
   execute the following command:</p>

   <p class="pre">gpg --send-keys A490D0F4D311A4153E2BB7CADBB802B258ACD84F</p>
   </div>

<a id="download"></a>

Download and verify the ISO image
=================================

In this step, you will download the latest Tails ISO image and verify it
using the Tails signing key.

1. Download the ISO image:

   <p class="pre">wget --continue https://un.poivron.org/~sajolida/tails-ux-testing.iso</p>

1. Download the signature of the ISO image:

   <p class="pre">wget https://un.poivron.org/~sajolida/tails-ux-testing.iso.sig</p>

1. Verify that the ISO image is signed by the Tails signing key:

   <p class="pre">gpg --keyid-format 0xlong --verify tails-ux-testing.iso.sig tails-ux-testing.iso</p>

   The output of this command should be the following:

   <pre>
gpg: Signature made Thu 19 Nov 2015 02:39:11 PM UTC
gpg:                using RSA key 0x3C83DCB52F699C56
gpg: Good signature from "Tails developers (offline long-term identity key) <tails@boum.org>" [full]
gpg:                 aka "Tails developers <tails@boum.org>" [full]
Primary key fingerprint: A490 D0F4 D311 A415 3E2B  B7CA DBB8 02B2 58AC D84F
     Subkey fingerprint: A509 1F72 C746 BA6B 163D  1C18 3C83 DCB5 2F69 9C56
   </pre>

   Verify in this output that:

     - The date of the signature is the same.
     - The signature is marked as <code>Good signature</code> since you
       certified the Tails signing key with your own key.
