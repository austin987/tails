   Tails does not start at all (troubleshooting)
   ---------------------------------------------

   The following section applies if the **Boot Tails** menu does not
   appear when starting on a USB stick.

   It is quite common for computers not to start automatically on a
   USB stick with Tails installed. Here are two troubleshooting techniques. You should try them
   one after the other.

   ### Getting to the boot menu

   On most computers, you can press a *boot menu key* to display a list of
   possible devices to start from. The following instructions explain how
   to display the boot menu and start on the USB stick. The following
   screenshot is an example of such boot menu:

   1. Identify the potential boot menu keys for the computer depending on
   the computer manufacturer in the following list:

      <table>
      <tr><th>Manufacturer</th><th>Key</th></tr>
      <tr><td>Acer</td><td>Esc, F12, F9</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Asus</td><td>Esc, F8</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Compaq</td><td>Esc, F9</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Dell</td><td>F12</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Fujitsu</td><td>F12, Esc</td></tr>
      <tr><td>HP</td><td>Esc, F9</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Lenovo</td><td>F12, Novo, F8, F10</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Samsung</td><td>Esc, F12, F2</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Sony</td><td>F11, Esc, F10</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Toshiba</td><td>F12</td></tr>
      <tr><td>others&hellip;</td><td>F12, Esc</td></tr>
      </table>

   1. Make sure that the first USB stick is plugged in the computer.

   1. Shut down the computer.

   1. Switch on the computer.

      Immediately press several times the first potential boot menu key identified in step 1.

      - If a boot menu with a list of possible devices to start from
        appears, select the first USB stick in the list and press **Enter**.

      - If the computer starts on
        <span class="windows">Windows,</span>
        <span class="linux">Linux,</span> repeat steps
        2 and 3 for all the potential boot menu keys identified in step 1.

   If none of the potential boot menu keys identified in step 1 work or if
   the USB stick does not appear in the list, then try the second
   troubleshooting technique described below.

   ### Edit the BIOS settings

   You might need to edit the BIOS settings of the computer.

   <div class="tip">
   <p>Search for the user guide of the computer on the website of its
   manufacturer to learn how to edit the BIOS settings.</p>
   </div>

   In the BIOS settings, try to apply the following changes one by one and
   restart the computer after each change. Some changes might not
   apply to certain computer models.

   <div class="caution">
   <p>Take note of the changes that you apply to the BIOS settings, to be
   able to revert them if they prevent the computer to start on
   <span class="windows">Windows.</span>
   <span class="linux">Linux.</span></p>
   </div>

   1. Edit the **Boot Order**. Depending on the computer model you might
   see an entry for **removable devices** or **USB media**. Move this entry
   to the top of the list to force the computer to try to start from
   the first USB stick before starting from the internal hard disk.

   1. Disable **Fast boot**.

   1. If the computer is configured to start with **legacy BIOS**, try to
   configure it to start with **UEFI**. Else, if the computer is configured
   to start with **UEFI**, try to configure it to start with **legacy
   BIOS**. To do so, try any of the following options if available:

      - Enable Legacy mode
      - Disable Secure boot
      - Enable CSM boot
      - Disable UEFI

   1. Try to upgrade the BIOS to the latest version provided by the manufacturer.

   If none of these options work, please [[report the problem to our
   support team|doc/first_steps/bug_reporting/tails_does_not_start]].
