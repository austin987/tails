When starting up Tails, several HTTP connections are made to various hosts including:
google.com
riseup.net
torproject.org

These connections are all done in close proximity to each other at startup which gives any performing a timing attack a distinct advantage.

This should be patched to not make ANY connections at startup beyond the expected Tor network connection.
