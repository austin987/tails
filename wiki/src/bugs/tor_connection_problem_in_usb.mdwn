Hi, I installed tails to USB and when I start it, I get problem with tor connections, here is copy/paste from controlpanel-messagelog-advanced:

	Mar 16 17:58:46.091 [Notice] Tor v0.2.2.35 (git-73ff13ab3cc9570d). This is experimental software. Do not rely on it for strong anonymity. (Running on Linux i686)
	Mar 16 17:58:46.096 [Notice] Initialized libevent version 1.4.13-stable using method epoll. Good.
	Mar 16 17:58:46.097 [Notice] Opening Socks listener on 127.0.0.1:9050
	Mar 16 17:58:46.097 [Warning] /var/run/tor is not owned by this user (amnesia, 1000) but by debian-tor (106). Perhaps you are running Tor as the wrong user?
	Mar 16 17:58:46.097 [Warning] Before Tor can create a control socket in "/var/run/tor/control", the directory "/var/run/tor" needs to exist, and to be accessible only by the user account that is running Tor. (On some Unix systems, anybody who can list a socket can conect to it, so Tor is being careful.)
	Mar 16 17:58:46.097 [Notice] Closing partially-constructed listener Socks listener on 127.0.0.1:9050
	Mar 16 17:58:46.097 [Warning] Failed to parse/validate config: Failed to bind one of the listener ports.
	Mar 16 17:58:46.097 [Error] Reading config failed--see warnings above.
