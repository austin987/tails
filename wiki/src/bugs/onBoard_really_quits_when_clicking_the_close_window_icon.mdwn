# Description

In T(A)ILS 0.5 (?), clicking the "Close window" cross on the right
of its window's top bar would hide onBoard into the notification area,
keeping it one-click-away from being used again.

The same operation now quits onBoard for real and one has to dig into
the programs menu in order to launch it again.

# Patch

The status bar context menu entry to quit onBoard was not working without
appindicator which made onBoard not trivial to close if the bug was solved.

A first patch solves this:
[[244_Effectively_close_onboard_through_the_GtkStatusIcon_menu]]

A second patch adds an option to iconify the keyboard window on close:
[[245_Add_an_option_to_iconify_the_keyboard_window_on_close]]

Next steps are probably:

- to include these patches in our debian package
- to propose them upstream
