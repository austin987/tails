As [written on thinkwiki](http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Category:X220)
and confirmed by a Tails user, the "X220 cannot/will not boot GPT
disks using Legacy BIOS, you must setup UEFI". This is a bug in
their firmware.

In practice, that means a Tails pendrive setup by the Tails USB
installer cannot boot on a ThinkPad X220, unless we add UEFI support
to Tails.

The same applies to ThinkPad T520 and E325. Other models are listed on
[[support/known_issues]].

The solution is to implement [[todo/UEFI]] support.
