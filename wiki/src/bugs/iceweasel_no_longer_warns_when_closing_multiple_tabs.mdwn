In Tails 0.7, even though "Edit > Preferences > Tabs > Warn me when
closing multiple tabs" is checked, and in about:config
browser.tabs.warnOnClose is true, Iceweasel does not display any
warning. It just closes down immediately when pressing the Close
Window "X" button provided by GNOME, or Ctrl-Q. This is a problem
since Ctrl-Q is so close to Ctrl-W. All work in the browser is lost,
way too easily. This is a bug since the browser is not performing the
behavior specificed by browser.tabs.warnOnClose.

The bug can be reproduced with iceweasel 5.0-3~bpo60+1 from
mozilla.debian.net (Tails `feature/ff4` branch).

Looks like [[!mozbug 419009]], and comment 161 suggests that the
following settings may workaround this bug:

	browser.warnOnQuit;true
	browser.showQuitWarning;true
	browser.tabs.warnOnClose;true

... but in my experience (Tails 0.12.1) it does not :(

Not done. Still present in 0.20.1, though only Ctrl-Q fails to notify.
