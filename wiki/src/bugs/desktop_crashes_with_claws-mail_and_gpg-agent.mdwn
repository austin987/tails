This was reported by a few users for months.

How to reproduce:

 * Use a system with persistance enabled for Claws Mail and GnuPG.
 * Configure Claws Mail to receive emails using POP3.
 * Configure Claws Mail to use a PGP key.
 * Open Claws Mail.
 * Get 2 PGP encrypted inline messages.
 * Click on first message, and when it asks for password,
   click *Cancel*.
 * Click on second message, and when it asks for password,
   click *Cancel*.

At this point, the system crashes.

We're told that disabling the *Preferences -> Plugins/GPG -> Uncheck
"Use gpg-agent"* setting in Claws Mails fixes the issue. Is Seahorse
misconfigured / misbehaving? What are the practical consequences of
disabling this use in Claws?

> Uncheking *"Use gpg-agent"* does its job as a workaround
> and the practical consequence is having to type your 
> passphrase for every single encrypted email no matter if
> all of them are encrypted for the same key.
