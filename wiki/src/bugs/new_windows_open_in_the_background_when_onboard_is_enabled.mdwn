In amnesia 0.4.2, new windows (e.g. software launched from the Gnome
menu, firegpg editor) now open in the background.

This bug did not happen before.

> Workaround: exit the onBoard virtual keyboard.
>
> We now have to find out where this onBoard / Metacity interaction
> bug comes from.
>
> This seems like a bug reported on
> [launchpad](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/metacity/+bug/197288)
> and in the [GNOME bug
> tracker](https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=534752).
> The suggested workaround (setting the GConf
> `/apps/metacity/general/focus_new_windows` to `strict`) has
> no effect in our setup :/
>
> Tests show that Debian Squeeze's metacity (2.28) still has this bug.
