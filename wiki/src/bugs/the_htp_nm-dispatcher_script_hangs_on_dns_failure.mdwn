The summary pretty much says it all. If any host in the server pool doesn't resolve through DNS, the script never terminates.  While not a terrible problem, it should fail more gracefully.
    This was a misunderstanding -- it's just the tails-htp-notificatin that never disappears on its own. However, as mentiioned in the [todo](https://amnesia.boum.org/todo/when_htp_fails_the_user_should_be_prompted/), these failures should be presented in a pop-up.
