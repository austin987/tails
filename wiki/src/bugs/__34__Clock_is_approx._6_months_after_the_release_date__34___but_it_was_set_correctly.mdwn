Here's a patch for /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/50-htp.sh

    39d38
    < 	mail.riseup.net
    177c176
    < 	if [ "$(($release_date_secs + 259200))" -lt "$current_date_secs" ]; then
    ---
    > 	if [ "$(($release_date_secs + 15552000))" -lt "$current_date_secs" ]; then

For the last two days, mail.riseup.net is frequently failing, triggering htpdate's paranoid mode. Thus /usr/local/sbin/htpdate returns an error to 50-htp.sh, which checks is_clock_way_off and finds the clock is more than 3 days (rather than the intended 180 days) later than Tails 0.8 release date. 

So, Tails boots up with the hardware clock set correctly, sets the software clock back to September 16, and then can't connect to Tor.

Output at /var/log/htpdate.log looks something like this:

    Running htpdate.
    https://ssl.scroogle.org (took 1s) => diff = 1 second(s)
    https://www.torproject.org (took 1s) => diff = 1 second(s)
    No downloaded files can be found
    No file could be downloaded from https://mail.riseup.net.
    Paranoid mode: aborting as one server ( https://mail.riseup.net ) could not be reached
    Clock is approx. 6 months after the release date
    Running htpdate.
    https://ssl.scroogle.org (took 1s) => diff = 1000000 second(s)
    https://www.torproject.org (took 1s) => diff = 1000000 second(s)
    No downloaded files can be found
    No file could be downloaded from https://mail.riseup.net.
    Paranoid mode: aborting as one server ( https://mail.riseup.net ) could not be reached
    htpdate exited with return code 25

If you're going to use paranoid mode, then you should stick to the most reliable servers. Apparently mail.riseup.net cannot always handle the traffic.

I'm reopening this because the closer showed no acknowledgment of the 3-day problem in /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/50-htp.sh

DNS resolution aside, you still need to apply this patch:

    177c176
    < 	if [ "$(($release_date_secs + 259200))" -lt "$current_date_secs" ]; then
    ---
    > 	if [ "$(($release_date_secs + 15552000))" -lt "$current_date_secs" ]; then

>>> Right. Applied to feature/tordate branch, thanks!

[[done]] in 0.9.
