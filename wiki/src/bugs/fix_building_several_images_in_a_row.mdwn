Fixing the apt/preferences lh
[bug](http://lists.debian.org/debian-live/2009/06/msg00181.html) will
re-allow building several images types in a row.

This bug is supposed to have been fixed in commit 22d95e7a32c78bd0f72
to `live-helper`. We should now:

- remove `config/chroot_local-includes/etc/apt/preferences`: *done*
- test it builds nicely
- check that the image has the correct packages versions
- check that the image has the correct `/etc/apt/preferences` and
  `/etc/apt/apt.conf`
- bump the required `live-helper` version in [[build]] and [[debian/control]]
- check we can build several images types in a row
- close this bug
