Hi Tails developers,
Here a bug: I run Tails from USB, when desktop shows, I start my wireless connection using the icon up-right corner, when connection established I receive the black-popup alert about "Tor-time-syncronization".. 4 times upon 5, Tor doesnt start and idle for 10 minutes, after it comes out another black-popup telling the synchronization failed, Tor starts but ends because cant connect, and after few seconds system becomes unstable and hungs totally, needs reset.. I tried to run tor manually but receive the error "port already binded"..
Question/workaround: is it possible to disable the "Tor-time-syncronization"?
Thanks :)
