I was using tcpdump and then wireshark to check for information leakage while
i was running Amnesia.


Amnesia successfully retrieved IP configuration by using local DHCP protocol,
and after that it synchronized with pool.ntp.org.


Both address resolving and NTP requests were plain, unencrypted.

The proposal is to start system with  NTPd after starting X. The only drawback here
will be caused by XScreenSaver (if running) when doing big clock adjustments.
