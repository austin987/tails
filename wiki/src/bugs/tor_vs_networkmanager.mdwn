When the network cable is unplugged at boot time, and plugged after
the Gnome session is started, no Tor circuit is built.
Restarting the Tor service is then needed.

Either the SIGHUP way now used to tell Tor to reconfigure itself is
insufficient, or NetworkManager does not invoke
`/etc/network/if-up.d/600tor` at all.

Re-opening, as the SIGHUP obviously isn't enough, resulting in Tor
failing to connect to the network.

The problem seems to be the that if Tor is in the process of
retrieving the dir info (like during bootstrap) it won't abort the
current retrieval and start a new one if it is instructed to do so,
e.g. by a SIGHUP or an application request.

This has been [reported to the Tor bug tracking
system](https://bugs.torproject.org/flyspray/index.php?do=details&id=1247).

Fixed in amnesia 0.5. [[!tag done]]

Workarounds
===========

amnesia built from Git
----------------------

A workaround has been applied to amnesia's Git, until this bug
is fixed. This bug is not closed yet as no published amnesia version
includes this workaround, and moreover, this is no real solution.

amnesia 0.4.2 or older
----------------------

One can run `sudo /etc/init.d/tor restart` after NetworkManager has
configured the network. Vidalia should then be quit and started again,
as it fails to reconnect to the new Tor instance.
