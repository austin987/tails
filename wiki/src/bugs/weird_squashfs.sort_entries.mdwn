With live-boot-3.x /live/rofs contains the mounted rofs squashfs. It
seems that the [[read-ahead profiling|todo/improve_boot_time_on_cd]]
includes a lot of files from there by mistake, including duplicates
e.g.:

    live/rofs/filesystem.squashfs/etc/group                              32766
    live/rofs/filesystem.squashfs/usr/share/amnesia/readahead-list       32765
    usr/share/amnesia/readahead-list                                     32764
    live/rofs/filesystem.squashfs/bin/touch                              32763
    bin/touch                                                            32762
    [...]

End result: Boot takes about twice as long as using no read-ahead at
all.

These "weird" lines must be taken care of some how. Until then,
read-ahead profiling is disabled.
