>> * Click 'New Identity' in Vidalia-Icon(toptasbar&in
>>   Browser.).Multiple.I get now new IP(check.torproject.org).

>>> Do you mean you get *no* new IP, that is you get the same IP
>>> as previously?

>>>> Yes,the same IP as previously.The same ExitNode(check.torproj....).

>>>>> I cannot reproduce that.

>>> First of all, a new circuit doesn't necessarily mean a new exit

>>> Also, did you close the web browser between your different

>>>> Closing or not closing -no difference

>>> For more explanation about this feature, please see our
>>> [[doc/about/warning]] page, that e.g. explains that Vidalia's "New

>>> connections: existing connections might stay open

>> * After more or less 10 minutes(normal circuit change ?) the 'New
>>   Identity'-function in Vidalia-Icon seems working(a new IP
     according to check.torproject.org).

>>> OK.

>> * Is this function dependent on about:config(delete
>>   URL-entries&JAVA-filelocation-entries)-seems not.

>>> Sorry, I don't understand what you mean.

>>>>> What do you mean by "this time"?
