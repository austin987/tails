"Running T(A)ILS from a CD has its virtues but it certainly also have its "
"limitations. While CDs are portable they usually do not fit in your pocket "
"in a comfortable manner. But a USB stick certainly fits any pocket or your "
"key ring.  In addition, CDs are read-only and thus no data can be saved to "
"them, but that is, again, not the case with USB sticks. However, storing "
"sensitive data on writeable media could be dangerous if it got into the "
"wrong hands. Similarly, if we get a virus or manages to damage the system in "
"other ways, the system is tainted or unusable from that point and all "
"consecutive boots, either with or without your knowledge. Clearly that is "
"not good."

"Note that the method of installing T(A)ILS onto a USB stick is pretty crude "
"at the moment (a more intuituve way is planned). If you do not know "
"precisely what the things mentioned below mean it is recommended to stop now "
"as you otherwise might risk overwriting any present hard drives. Proceed at "
"your own discretion!"

"There is also a third path that would be worth mentioning: most SD cards "
"have a read-only switch. It might cost a little bit more, but not much, to "
"buy an USB SD card reader and a SD card with such switch. That way, you can "
"keep your T(A)ILS system read-only when you are not upgrading it, something "
"closer to a CD-RW than a plain USB stick."
