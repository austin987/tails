[[!meta title="Virtualization: tips and tricks"]]

As explained on the [[virtualization warning
page|support/virtualization]], using Tails in a Virtual Machine
involves you put great trust into the host operating system and the
virtualization software.

Here are some tips may help hardening (a bit) the host operating
system.

# Operating systems

## Microsoft Windows

You should NOT trust Windows to be secure if you use Tails for anything you consider risky. Windows could be made a tiny bit more
trustworthy if you installed a HIPS (Host Intrusion Prevention System)
with high security settings instantly after installing Windows If Windows not is installed from a genuine Windows CD/DVD you can not trust it enough, not even if it's a preinstalled copy of Windows (there have been cases of computers being shipped with malware). If you install a HIPS first after
using Windows for some time (less then an hour online is enough) you
could already have a rootkit that the HIPS can't detect.
Even with a HIPS you should not use Windows as a host OS if you risk personal harm for your use of Tails.

If you are unsure, just run Tails from a LiveCD. Make sure that you have verified the ISO file first so that nobody has tampered with it. Go find a local Linux user group or similiar for assistance if you need it.
