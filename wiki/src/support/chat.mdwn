[[!meta title="Chat"]]

Join our XMPP chat room to ask questions about Tails.

To do so, you need an XMPP account. Some email providers, such as
[Riseup](https://help.riseup.net/en/chat), provide XMPP accounts as well.

Then configure your preferred instant messaging client, for example
[[Pidgin|http://www.pidgin.im/]], which runs on Windows, GNU/Linux, and
macOS, to connect to:

* server: `conference.riseup.net`
* room: `tails`
* Use TLS/SSL to connect!
