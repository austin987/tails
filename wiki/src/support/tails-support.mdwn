[[!meta title="Tails user support mailing list"]]

This list is **the right place** for:

  - **User support**: solving doubts about how to use Tails, security
    implications of Tails, etc.
  - **Community interaction**: information and tricks about ways of
    using Tails that are not officially documented but might be of
    interest to others.
  - **Small issues**: pointing out small things that we needed to fix
    and do not require a complete bug report.  That's fine and we
    appreciate it.

This list is **the wrong place** for:

  - **Bug reports**: see the [[bug reporting
    documentation|/doc/first_steps/bug_reporting]] instead.
  - **Feature requests**: those should be done on the development
    mailing list
    [tails-dev@boum.org](https://mailman.boum.org/listinfo/tails-dev/).
  - **Computer security essays and conspiranoia** not directly related
    to Tails.
