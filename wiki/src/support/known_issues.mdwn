Problems starting Tails
=======================

This section lists known problems with specific hardware. To report a problem
with different hardware see our [[report guidelines when Tails does not
start|doc/first_steps/bug_reporting/tails_does_not_start]].

Problematic USB sticks
----------------------

<a id="sandisk"></a>

### SanDisk

Many SanDisk USB sticks are configured by the
manufacturer as a fixed disk, and not as a removable disk. As a consequence,
they require removing the `live-media=removable` boot parameter, which [[is
dangerous|doc/first_steps/bug_reporting/tails_does_not_start#entirely]].

* SanDisk Cruzer Edge 8GB
* SanDisk Cruzer Extreme USB 3.0 16GB and 32GB
* SanDisk Cruzer Fit USB 2.0 8GB, 16GB, and 32G
* SanDisk Cruzer Force 8GB
* SanDisk Cruzer Glide 4GB, 8GB and 16GB
* SanDisk Cruzer Switch USB 2.0 8GB and 32GB
* SanDisk Cruzer USB 3.0 64GB
* SanDisk Cruzer Blade 4GB, 8GB, and 32GB
* SanDisk Cruzer Facet
* SanDisk Cruzer Orbiter 32GB (hangs at installation time but boots fine afterwards)
* SanDisk Ultra 32 GB

SanDisk had begun the production of flash drives configured as fixed disk in
2012 to meet new requirements for Windows 8 Certification, and ended it in mid-2014. The flash drives that
comply with this certification will have the Windows 8 logo on their packaging.
If a flash drive does not have the Windows 8 logo on its packaging, then that
drive will function as a removable disk and should work with Tails.

See also [[!tails_ticket 6397]].

### PNY

When installing Tails, PNY USB sticks have problems with the constant write load
and are prone to failure.

### Other vendors

* Staples Relay USB 2.0 16GB, suffers from the same problem as [[some SanDisk USB sticks|known_issues#sandisk]].

Acer Travelmate 8573T-254G50M
-----------------------------

Booting from DVD works fine, but does not start on USB sticks created
using Tails Installer.

This problem might be corrected in Tails 1.1 and newer: please report
your test results back to us.

ASUS VivoBook X202E
-------------------

Legacy support needs to be enabled in order to start Tails. To enable
legacy boot support, enable 'Launch CSM' under boot (menu).

This problem might be corrected in Tails 1.1 and newer: please report
your test results back to us.

Compaq 615
----------

You need to update the firmware to its latest version in order to start from a
device installed using Tails Installer.

Dell Inc. Latitude E6430 and E6230
----------------------------------

Does not start on USB sticks created using Tails Installer.

With BIOS versions A03 06/03/2012 (and A09, A11, and A12)

Error message: `Invalid partition table!`

Workaround (at least with BIOS versions A09, A11, and A12): just hit enter
and it will continue with the boot.

This problem might be corrected in Tails 1.1 and newer: please report
your test results back to us.

Dell XPS L702X/03RG89, Samsung RV520, Samsung Series 7 Chronos
--------------------------------------------------------------

Does not start on USB sticks created using Tails Installer.

We were reported that the legacy BIOS shipped on these systems doesn't
know how to deal with the GPT partition scheme installed by Tails
Installer.

This problem might be corrected in Tails 1.1 and newer: please report
your test results back to us.

<http://en.community.dell.com/support-forums/laptop/f/3518/p/19392884/20010995.aspx>

Dell Inspiron 8100
------------------

The display panel will have the wrong resolution unless `video=LVDS-1:1600x1200
nouveau.noaccel=1` is added to the boot command line. This problem might be
corrected in Tails 1.1 and newer: please report your test results back
to us.

Dell Dimension 2400
-------------------

Cannot start neither from USB nor from DVD. System crashes with a blank
screen and locked up keyboard. This problem might be corrected in
newer versions: please report your test results back to us.

HP ProBook 4330s
----------------

With UEFI enabled, when chosing a boot device, select `Boot From EFI File` and
then `Filesystem Tails` and `EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi`.

Lenovo IdeaPad Y410p
--------------------

Cannot start Tails 1.1 from USB installed manually in Linux.

Lenovo IdeaPad z585
-------------------

Goes back continuously to boot menu on Tails installed on DVD.

Clevo W258CU, ThinkPad X121e, T420i, T410, T520, W520, T530, E325 and E530
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

These machines do not start on USB sticks created using Tails USB
Installer, due to a firmware limitation.

A workaround for some of these machines is to use the [[manual
installation process|doc/first_steps/installation/manual/linux]].
Note, however, that this technique does not allow you to set up
a persistent volume.

This problem might be corrected in Tails 1.1 and newer: please report
your test results back to us.

<a id="mac"></a>

Mac
---

* Some Mac need [rEFInd](http://sourceforge.net/projects/refind/)
  installed to boot Tails from a USB stick.
* Any Mac with 32-bit EFI won't succeed in booting Tails USB stick
  created by Tails Installer. You can check if a given Mac is 32-bit
  or 64-bit EFI on that list:
  <http://www.everymac.com/mac-answers/snow-leopard-mac-os-x-faq/mac-os-x-snow-leopard-64-bit-macs-64-bit-efi-boot-in-64-bit-mode.html>
* MacBookPro5,5 does not boot with Tails in UEFI mode.
* MacBook Air 3,2 (A1369 EMC 2392) freezes when booting Tails in
  UEFI mode.
* MacBookPro (early 2011) fails to boot from DVD since Tails 1.1.
* Mac Pro Tower and MacBook Pro 4,1 (both from early 2008) and MacBookPro late 2011 (8,2) fail to boot from a USB stick created by
  Tails Installer.

<a id="chainloading"></a>

Chainloading Tails from GRUB
----------------------------

To workaround problems in booting Tails on laptops with UEFI support, it is
possible to chainload the syslinux on the ISO image from another boot loader
that is already working on the laptop, like GRUB. Be careful not to modify at
all the options of syslinux in the process.

The following commands, run from the GRUB shell, might be helpful:

    set root=(hd1)
    chainloader +1
    boot

Other hardware issues
=====================

<a id="bcm43224"></a>

Broadcom BCM43224 802.11a/b/g/n wireless network adapter
--------------------------------------------------------

The Broadcom Corporation BCM43224 802.11a/b/g/n wireless network
adapter is known to not be able to
[[spoof its MAC address|doc/first_steps/startup_options/mac_spoofing]]. Tails
enables MAC spoofing by default, and will disable any network adapter
it fails to spoof. To make it work you must
[[disable Tails' MAC spoofing feature|doc/first_steps/startup_options/mac_spoofing#disable]];
please read the documentation carefully and make sure you understand
the consequences before doing so.

This network adapter can, for instance, be found in the MacBook Air
4,1, 4,2, 5,1 and 5,2.

Security issues
===============

Tails might not erase all the system memory on shutdown
-------------------------------------------------------

On rare systems (non-PAE with big amounts of memory),
Tails does not consistently [[!tails_todo
more_efficient_memory_wipe desc="erase all system memory as it
should"]].

If no [[cold boot attack|doc/advanced_topics/cold_boot_attacks]]
happens directly after shutdown, the RAM empties itself in minutes,
and all data disappears.

After using Tails Installer, the "emergency shutdown" doesn't work
------------------------------------------------------------------

Tails Installer messes a bit too much with the USB devices for the
"emergency shutdown on media removal" feature to continue working after using
it. If you believe this feature is critical for the session you're running, we
advice you to reboot Tails.

Tails DVD eject failure
-----------------------

Pressing the DVD eject button does not trigger emergency shutdown.
Also, the "normal" (non-emergency) shutdown procedure does not eject
the DVD anymore.

(Ticket: [[!tails_todo fix_DVD_eject_at_shutdown]])

Stream isolation inconsistency in Claws Mail
--------------------------------------------

Claws Mail isn't using its dedicated Tor SocksPort for Tor hidden
service IMAP/POP/SMTP servers (instead Tor's TransPort is used). This
is just a deviation from Tails' design and should have no adverse real
world consequences.

Tails fails to completely shutdown or restart
---------------------------------------------

When stopping Tails on some hardware, the memory wipe procedure fails to
complete: the display gets scrambled, but the computer doesn't
completely shutdown or restart. Sometimes the caps-lock button light of
the keyboard flashes.

<div class="caution">

When this happens, there is no guarantee that the memory is wiped entirely.

</div>

This issue has been reported on the following hardware:

  - Apple when booting from a USB stick:
    - MacBook Air 5,1
    - MacBook Pro 7,1, 13-inch mid 2010
    - MacBook Pro 9,2, 13-inch mid 2012
    - MacBook Pro 8,1, 13-inch late 2011
    - MacBook Pro 10,2
    - MacBook Pro Retina 11,1, late 2013
  - Hewlett-Packard HP Pavilion dv6 Notebook PC
  - Lenovo ThinkPad X61, only on emergency shutdown when pulling out the
    USB stick
  - Toshiba Satellite C855D
  - Dell Inc. Studio 1458
  - Fujitsu Lifebook AH531/GFO, only on regular shutdown, emergency
    shutdown works
  - Samsung N150P

<a id="fingerprint"></a>

Fingerprint
===========

<!-- If this section is empty adjust the [[fingerprint documentation|doc/about/fingerprint]]. -->

<!-- The fingerprints of <span class="application">Tor Browser</span> in Tails and on other operating systems are different: -->

* Browser window resizing is in not reliable: [[!tails_ticket 6377]]
  and [[!tor_bug 10095]].

Other issues
============

<a id="i2p_browser"></a>

Hard to exchange files with the I2P Browser
-------------------------------------------

It is impossible to exchange files between the I2P Browser and the amnesia user.
See [[!tails_ticket 8280]]. But you can do that with
administration rights from the command line. The home directory of the I2P Browser is
located in `/var/lib/i2p-browser/chroot/home/i2pbrowser/`.

You might have to check the permissions of the files that you want to exchange
with the I2P Browser:

  - They need to belong to the `i2pbrowser` user to be accessible from inside
    of the I2P browser.
  - They need to belong to the `amnesia` user to be accessible from outside of
    the I2P Browser.

Boot menu has display issues
----------------------------

Since Tails 1.1, one some hardware (ThinkPad X230, MacBookPro8,1),
the boot menu is not displayed properly. Tails starts fine, though.

Connecting to FTP servers is not possible
-----------------------------------------

Public FTP servers on the Internet are not reachable using Tails.
See [[!tails_todo fix_Internet_FTP_support desc="the corresponding
task"]] for more details.

Tails fails to connect to certain Wi-Fi networks
------------------------------------------------

This might be related to the introduction of wireless regulation support
in Tails 0.13.

VirtualBox guest modules are broken for 64-bit guests
-----------------------------------------------------

VirtualBox guest modules allow for additional features when using Tails as a
VirtualBox guest: shared folders, resizable display, shared clipboard, etc.

But due to [a bug in VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/11037), the
resizable display and shared clipboard
only work in Tails if the VirtualBox guest is configured to have a 32-bit
processor. The shared folders work both on 32-bit and 64-bit guests.

The desktop crashes when run with the default QEMU emulated processor
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Due to a [bug in llvmpipe](https://freedesktop.org/patch/34445/), when
Tails runs in a QEMU virtual machine with the default emulated CPU,
the GNOME desktop crashes after login.

To workaround this problem, pass @-cpu host@ on the QEMU command-line.
If you use <span class="application">libvirt</span>, choose <span
class="guilabel">Copy host CPU configuration</span> in <span
class="application">virt-manager</span>'s processor configuration screen.

Touchpad configurations
-----------------------

### Acer TravelMate B113 - ETPS/2 Elantech Touchpad

    synclient FingerPress=256;
    synclient TapButton3=0;
    synclient Clickpad=1;
    synclient VertTwoFingerScroll=1;
    synclient FingerLow=1;
    synclient FingerHigh=1;

Bluetooth devices don't work
----------------------------

Bluetooth is not enabled in Tails for security reasons. To enable it
anyway, see the documentation about
[[wireless devices|doc/advanced_topics/wireless_devices]].

Tor Browser takes too long to shutdown
--------------------------------------

Since Tails 0.22, the browser sometimes takes too long to shutdown
([[!tails_ticket 6480]]). Waiting a few more seconds is usually enough
to let it close itself correctly.

<a id="browser_languages"></a>

Tor Browser is translated in a limited number of languages
----------------------------------------------------------

Since Tails 1.2, the web browser is based on Tor Browser which is
translated in less languages than before. You can see the list of
languages available in Tor Browser from the [Tor Browser
homepage](https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en).
