Last updated: 2014-08-02

I asked help desk about it.

PNY is quite popular among WB reporters:

    436 SanDisk
    187 Kingston
    119 USB
     88 Generic
     82 Lexar
     79 Intenso
     57 Verbatim
     56 TOSHIBA
     50 PNY

If it was still problematic on all PNY USB sticks, this issue would
still be loud on help desk. Is it?

When installing Tails, PNY USB sticks have problems with the constant write load
and are prone to failure.

Some Broadcom Wi-Fi interfaces require the
[`wl`](https://wiki.debian.org/wl) driver, provided by the
`broadcom-sta-dkms` Debian package, to work in Tails.

The `wl` driver is not included in Tails because it is proprietary.

You device requires the `wl` driver if it is in the list of devices
supported by the `broadcom-sta-dkms` package on the corresponding
[Debian wiki page](https://wiki.debian.org/wl). If you find your device
in the list of supported devices, then it is impossible to use your
Wi-Fi card in Tails.

<h2 id="automatic-upgrade-fails">Tails fails to start or behaves weirdly after an automatic upgrade</h2>

<!--
Last updated: 2019-07-31
-->

Sometimes, after an automatic upgrade, your Tails might either:

- Fail to start. Often after the message:

  <pre>Loading, please wait...</pre>

- Behave weirdly. For example, your keyboard does not work or you cannot
  connect to a network.

To fix this problem, you can [[update your Tails
manually|doc/upgrade/#manual]].

Note that your Persistent Storage will be safely preserved.

<h2 id="persistence-disappears"><em>Persistent</em> folder disappears and data of the Persistent Storage is unavailable</h2>

Sometimes, the *Persistent* folder is missing and
all the data of the Persistent Storage is unavailable.

Most likely this means that the *persistence.conf*
file has disappeared. However, the files in the
*Persistent* folder and all the other data in the Persistent Storage
should still exist.

If you encounter this problem:

1. Unlock the Persistent Storage in
   the Welcome Screen when starting Tails.

1. Choose
   <span class="menuchoice">
     <span class="guimenu">Applications</span>&nbsp;▸
     <span class="guisubmenu">Tails</span>&nbsp;▸
     <span class="guimenuitem">Configure persistent volume</span></span>.

1. If you are asked to enter a passphrase, enter the same passphrase that you
   use to unlock your Persistent Storage.

1. Turn on the features of the Persistent Storage that you had turned on previously.

1. Click <span class="button">Save</span>, then restart Tails.

Your *Persistent* folder and all the data of the Persistent Storage
should be restored.

If the above instructions do not fix the problem, you might need to fix the
ownership of `TailsData_unlocked`.

To fix the ownership of TailsData_unlocked, set an administration password and
execute the following command in a terminal:

`sudo chown root:root /live/persistence/TailsData_unlocked`

<h2 id="languages-incorrect-keyboard-layout">Some languages do not have the correct keyboard layout set by default</h2>

<!--
Last updated: 2017-08-07
-->

When selecting some languages in the Welcome Screen, the default associated
keyboard layout fallbacks to US.

To use the right keyboard layout during a session, set it in the Welcome
Screen after having set the language. When the desktop has started, apply
the keyboard layout by clicking on the `en` systray icon.

Affected language codes are `AYC`, `BHB`, `BRX`, `CMN`, `HAK`, `HNE`, `LIJ`,
`LZH`, `MHR`, `NAN`, `NHN`, `QUZ`, `SGS`, `SHS`, `TCY`, `THE`, `UNM`, `WAE` and
`YUE`.

<h2 id="openpgp-prompt-steals-focus">The OpenPGP passphrase prompt steals the keyboard and mouse focus</h2>

<!--
Last updated: 2018-01-15

This happens when the GnuPG feature of the Persistent Storage was turned on before
Tails 2.3. To fix this problem, execute the following command in
a
[[terminal|doc/first_steps/introduction_to_gnome_and_the_tails_desktop#terminal]]:

	echo "no-grab" >> ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf

<h2 id="utc">Problems when the system clock goes backwards</h2>

When connecting to Tor, Tails sets the system time to the current time
in the [[!wikipedia Coordinated_Universal_Time]] (UTC) timezone.
Many operating systems, such as Linux and macOS, write time expressed
in UTC to the hardware clock of the computer. But, Windows instead
writes time expressed in the local timezone to the hardware clock of
the computer. So, if you are east of the United Kingdom (which is in the UTC timezone) on
a computer that also runs Windows, Tails will make the system clock go
backwards during startup. Unfortunately, this might trigger software
errors in Tails.

For example, when the system clock goes backwards:

<ul>
<li>The <span class="guimenu">Applications</span> menu might stop
working.</li>
<li>[[Connecting to Tor using `obfs4` bridges|doc/first_steps/welcome_screen/bridge_mode]]
might be impossible and <span class="application">Tor Launcher</span>
might get stuck on <span class="guilabel">Loading Network
Consensus</span>.</li>
</ul>

To solve this problem permanently on a Windows computer,
[set the hardware clock of the computer to UTC](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/System_time#UTC_in_Windows).

To workaround this issue, you can try to:

- Use other USB ports. For example, use USB 2 ports instead of USB 3
  ports and vice versa.

- Enable these 3 options in the BIOS

  - xHCI handoff
  - EHCI handoff
  - IOMMU controller

- [[Add the following boot option when
  starting Tails|doc/advanced_topics/boot_options]]:

      amd_iommu=on iommu=pt

- Disable IOMMU in the BIOS then enable it again.

Some of these workarounds may disable some of the USB ports.
