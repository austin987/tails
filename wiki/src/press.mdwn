## 2013

* 2013-12: Bruce Schneier
  [answered](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r8ibh/iama_security_technologist_and_author_bruce/cdknf7a)
  to someone asking him what Linux distribution is its favorite: "I don't
  use Linux. (Shhh. Don't tell anyone.) Although I have started using Tails".
* Jacob Appelbaum stated at the [Chaos Communication
  Congress](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2013/Fahrplan/events/5713.html):
  "if you are a journalist and you are not using Tails, you should
  probably be using Tails, unless you *really* know what
  you're doing".
* 2013-12-12: In [A conversation with Bruce
  Schneier](http://boingboing.net/2013/12/15/bruce-schneier-and-eben-moglen-2.html),
  as part of the "Snowden, the NSA and free software" cycle at
  Columbia Law School NYC, Bruce Schneier says:
  - "I think most of the public domain privacy tools are going to be
    safe, yes. I think GPG is going to be safe. I think OTR is going
    to be safe. I think that Tails is going to be safe. I do think
    that these systems, because they were not -- you know, the NSA has
    a big lever when a tool is written closed-source by a for-profit
    corporation. There are levers they have that they don't have in
    the open source international, altruistic community. And these are
    generally written by crypto-paranoids, they're pretty well
    designed. We make mistakes, but we find them and we correct them,
    and we're getting good at that. I think that the NSA is going
    after these tools, they're going after implementations."
  - "What do I trust? I trust, I trust Tails, I trust GPG [...]"
  - "We can make it harder, we can make it more expensive, we can make
    it more risky. And yes, every time we do something to increase one
    of those, we're making ourselves safer. [...] There are tools we
    are deploying in countries all over the world, that are keeping
    people alive. Tor is one of them. I mean, Tor saves lives. [...]
    And every time you use Tor [...] provides cover for everyone else
    who uses Tor [...]"
* 2013-11: The German-speaking ADMIN magazine [reviews
  Tails](http://www.admin-magazin.de/Das-Heft/2013/11/Tails-0.20).
* 2013-10 : (in french) Framablog, [Le chiffrement, maintenant](http://www.framablog.org/index.php/post/2013/10/19/Le-chiffrement-maintenant-compil), contains a whole chapter about Tails.
* 2013-10 : SecureDrop, "Aaron Swartz’s unfinished whistleblowing platform" promotes Tails in both [user manual](https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop/blob/master/docs/user_manual.md) and [security audit](http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~aczeskis/research/pubs/UW-CSE-13-08-02.PDF). via [Korben.info](http://korben.info/securedrop-aaron-swartz.html)
* 2013-10: The [occasional issue n°8 of
  MISC](http://boutique.ed-diamond.com/misc-hors-series/500-mischs8.html)
  magazine is dedicated to privacy topics. Tails is mentioned
  a few times.
* 2013-10-15: [CRYPTO-GRAM, October 15, 2013](http://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram-1310.html)
  Bruce Schneier: "One thing I didn't do, although it's worth considering, is
  use a stateless operating system like Tails. You can configure Tails with a
  persistent volume to save your data, but no operating system changes are ever
  saved. Booting Tails from a read-only DVD -- you can keep your data on an
  encrypted USB stick -- is even more secure. Of course, this is not foolproof,
  but it greatly reduces the potential avenues for attack."
* 2013-09-12: In [Inside the Effort to Crowdfund NSA-Proof Email and
  Chat
  Services](http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/inside-the-effort-to-crowdfund-nsa-proof-email-and-chat-services)

  TrueCrypt, BleachBit, and a few other things I'm not going to
  write about."
