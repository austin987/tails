Media appearances
=================

As Tails is being more and more used throughout the world, it is
mentioned regularly in the press and in research papers. This list is
not comprehensive, but illustrates some of the significant articles
that have been published about Tails.

## 2014

* 2014-02-27: The Daily Dot announced the experiments on porting Tails to mobile
  devices in "[Tor takes anonymity mobile with new smartphone
  OS](http://www.dailydot.com/technology/tor-anonymous-os-tails-freitas/)".
  Note that this is not an official project of Tails, see the homepage of the
  [Tomy Detachable Secure Mobile
  System](https://dev.guardianproject.info/projects/libro/wiki/Tomy_Detachable_Secure_Mobile_System)
  project for more info.
* 2014-02-27: In his article "[Why It’s Vital For Users to Fund Open-Source
  Encryption
  Tools](https://pressfreedomfoundation.org/blog/2014/02/why-its-vital-public-fund-open-source-encryption-tools)"
  Trevor Timm from Freedom of the Press Foundation explains that Tails « has
  been vital for most, if not all, of the NSA journalists. [...] Its prime use
  case is journalists trying to communicate or work in environments in which
  they may normally be at risk or compromised. The NSA stories have been the
  biggest story in journalism in the past decade, yet the tool the reporters
  rely on is incredibly underfunded, is maintained by only a handful of
  developers, and operates on a shoestring budget. »
* 2014-02-07: In his review of [uVirtus](http://uvirtus.org), Kheops, from
  Telecomix concludes that « Users should prefer Tails and other mature secure
  live distributions (such as IprediaOS, Liberté Linux, Privatix and Whonix)
  over uVirtus since they provide a real safety improvement to the user. For any
  activity that does not entail transferring large quantities of data (such as
  video files), there is no strong reason to prefer uVirtus over any of these. »
* 2014-01-14: On Linux.com, Carla Schroder [picks
  Tails](https://www.linux.com/news/software/applications/752221-the-top-7-best-linux-distros-for-2014/)
  as the best Linux distribution for 2014 in the "Best Fighting the
  Man Distro" category.
* 2014-01-07: [A RAT in the Registry: The Case for Martus on
  TAILS](http://benetech.org/2014/01/07/a-rat-in-the-registry-the-case-for-martus-on-tails/)
  explains how Benetech have selected TAILS (The Amnesic Incognito
  Live System) to be the default environment for their use of Martus while
  defending Tibetan human rights defenders against targeted malware attacks.
* 2014-01: "Tails: The Amnesiac Incognito Live System – Privacy for
  Anyone Anywhere", by Russ McRee, in this month's issue of the
  [Information Systems Security Association
  Journal](http://www.issa.org/?page=ISSAJournal).

## 2013

* 2013-12: Bruce Schneier
  [answered](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1r8ibh/iama_security_technologist_and_author_bruce/cdknf7a)
  to someone asking him what Linux distribution is its favorite: "I don't
  use Linux. (Shhh. Don't tell anyone.) Although I have started using Tails".
* 2013-12-30: Jacob Appelbaum stated at the [Chaos Communication
  Congress](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2013/Fahrplan/events/5713.html):
  "if you are a journalist and you are not using Tails, you should
  probably be using Tails, unless you *really* know what
  you're doing".
* 2013-12-12: In [A conversation with Bruce
  Schneier](http://boingboing.net/2013/12/15/bruce-schneier-and-eben-moglen-2.html),
  as part of the "Snowden, the NSA and free software" cycle at
  Columbia Law School NYC, Bruce Schneier says:
  - "I think most of the public domain privacy tools are going to be
    safe, yes. I think GPG is going to be safe. I think OTR is going
    to be safe. I think that Tails is going to be safe. I do think
    that these systems, because they were not -- you know, the NSA has
    a big lever when a tool is written closed-source by a for-profit
    corporation. There are levers they have that they don't have in
    the open source international, altruistic community. And these are
    generally written by crypto-paranoids, they're pretty well
    designed. We make mistakes, but we find them and we correct them,
    and we're getting good at that. I think that if the NSA is going
    after these tools, they're going after implementations."
  - "What do I trust? I trust, I trust Tails, I trust GPG [...]"
  - "We can make it harder, we can make it more expensive, we can make
    it more risky. And yes, every time we do something to increase one
    of those, we're making ourselves safer. [...] There are tools we
    are deploying in countries all over the world, that are keeping
    people alive. Tor is one of them. I mean, Tor saves lives. [...]
    And every time you use Tor [...] provides cover for everyone else
    who uses Tor [...]"
* 2013-11-12: In its review "[Which Linux distro is best for protecting your
  privacy?](http://www.techradar.com/news/software/operating-systems/which-linux-distro-is-best-for-protecting-your-privacy--1192771)",
  techrada.com prefers Tails over 4 other distributions: "The main advantages of
  Tails are its readiness for USB installation and the complete nature of its
  desktop and its documentation. The Tails system menu also contains enough
  applications to make you do almost everything you may need without rebooting.
  The documentation, while not interesting as the one for Whonix, is more than
  adequate to help even Linux beginners. Yay for Tails, then!"
* 2013-11: The German-speaking ADMIN magazine [reviews
  Tails](http://www.admin-magazin.de/Das-Heft/2013/11/Tails-0.20).
* 2013-10 : (in french) Framablog, [Le chiffrement, maintenant](http://www.framablog.org/index.php/post/2013/10/19/Le-chiffrement-maintenant-compil), contains a whole chapter about Tails.
* 2013-10 : SecureDrop, "Aaron Swartz’s unfinished whistleblowing platform" promotes Tails in both [user manual](https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop/blob/master/docs/user_manual.md) and [security audit](http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~aczeskis/research/pubs/UW-CSE-13-08-02.PDF). via [Korben.info](http://korben.info/securedrop-aaron-swartz.html)
* 2013-10: The [occasional issue n°8 of
  MISC](http://boutique.ed-diamond.com/misc-hors-series/500-mischs8.html)
  magazine is dedicated to privacy topics. Tails is mentioned
  a few times.
* 2013-10-15: [CRYPTO-GRAM, October 15, 2013](http://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram-1310.html)
  Bruce Schneier: "One thing I didn't do, although it's worth considering, is
  use a stateless operating system like Tails. You can configure Tails with a
  persistent volume to save your data, but no operating system changes are ever
  saved. Booting Tails from a read-only DVD -- you can keep your data on an
  encrypted USB stick -- is even more secure. Of course, this is not foolproof,
  but it greatly reduces the potential avenues for attack."
* 2013-09-12: In [Inside the Effort to Crowdfund NSA-Proof Email and
  Chat
  Services](http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/inside-the-effort-to-crowdfund-nsa-proof-email-and-chat-services)
  by DJ Pangburn, Riseup birds write (about the TBB) "Combined with
  the TAILS project, which Riseup supports, there is nothing better."
* 2013-09-05: In [How to remain secure against NSA
  surveillance](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/05/nsa-how-to-remain-secure-surveillance),
  Bruce Schneier wrote: "Since I started working with Snowden's
  documents, I have been using GPG, Silent Circle, Tails, OTR,
  TrueCrypt, BleachBit, and a few other things I'm not going to
  write about."

* 2013-08-12: [Anonym und sicher Surfen mit

  in the September edition of the
  [LinuxUser](http://www.linux-user.de/) magazine, that includes Tails
  on the accompanying DVD.
* 2013-08-11: In their [DeadDrop/StrongBox Security
  Assessment](http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~aczeskis/research/pubs/UW-CSE-13-08-02.PDF),
  a research group (Alexei Czeskis, David Mah, Omar Sandoval, Ian
  Smith, Karl Koscher, Jacob Appelbaum, Tadayoshi Kohno, and Bruce
  Schneier) suggests inserting Tails in the loop of the
  DeadDrop/StrongBox system. They also write: "We believe that sources
  should be adviced to use the Tails LiveCD. This provides better
  anonymity and is easier to use than the Tor Browser bundle."
