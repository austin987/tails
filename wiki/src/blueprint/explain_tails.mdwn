Tails in 2 sentences
====================

Original proposal:

<blockquote>
<p>Tails is a portable operating system that protects your privacy and
anonymity.</p>

<p>Just like Windows or macOS, it runs on your computer and allows you
to edit files, browse the web, and send email.</p>

<p>But unlike a traditional OS, it runs on a USB stick that you can plug
in and use on almost any computer.</p>
</blockquote>

Comments:

- 1
  - Will it protect my privacy when I'm browsing?
  - Portable?
  - Do users understand portable in the sense of our context
- 2
  - Does the audience know what an OS is?
  - Runs on a computer?
  - Runs on a USB stick?
- 3
  - Who is targeted? Though I like that it could talk to any type of
    user -- Very simple statement.
  - Maybe emphasize that advantages of USB sticks on DVD? (+) others
    computers?
  - Maybe the "WHY" is missing? → empowerment
  - Second sentence may give the impression that it has only basic
    features.
  - Is it useful to explain that is does not run on some computers?
- 4
  - portable operating system → ♥
  - By making every 1 look the same
  - "run on your computer" → ?
  - [any computer] and forgets everything between sessions
  - amnesia, forgets everything
  - everyone looks the same
- 5
  - Transportable? Pocketable?
  - Confidential / Secret
  - Amnesia → missing
- 6
  - Portable!
  - USB stick in 1st sentence
  - Instead of Win and macOS
  - amnesia or keep it for later
  - merge USB stick with Win & macOS

Updated proposal:

<blockquote>

<p>Tails is a portable operating system that protects your privacy and
avoids censorship.</p>

<p>Install Tails on a USB stick and run it on any computer instead of
Windows or macOS.</p>

Metaphors
=========

Camping
-------

### Tails as a tent

From "[Writing good documentation](https://platform.internetfreedomfestival.org/en/IFF2018/public/schedule/custom/426)" at the IFF 2018

- [Drawing of an unfolded tent] portable, set up anywhere in the world or your own backyard
- [Drawing of two similar tents]
- [Drawing of a tent in a bag] small portable tent fits in backpack, with your belongings.
- [Drawing of a tent city of similar tents]

- Amnesic
  - Empty every time its setup
  - Stored in backpack ("USB stick") along with "stuff" which can be
    moved into the tent ("persistence") or not.
- Incognito
  - Can move around (change "address")
  - Many tents look alike
  - Works best among other tents (not in a library)
- Live
  - Can carry around in backpack
  - Can set up in backyard (own laptop) or away from home
- Put it away when its finished

"[Leave No Trace](https://lnt.org/)" is an organization and a code of ethics
for outdoor activities.

Open relationship
-----------------

Tails is not my main operating system: Tails does not make me choose
between itself and other operating systems. With Tails I have an open
relationship. Is not my main operating system, I have other operating
systems for other things.

One in my laptop, one in my school...

Tails is not jealous and does not aim to fulfill all my computer needs:
if I need something Tails cannot give me... I can use another operating
system!

But I respect our relationship: Tails does not want to be plugged to my
laptop if I am running other operating systems, so I never do that.

And I don't use identities I use on other operating systems from the
same Tails USB stick.
