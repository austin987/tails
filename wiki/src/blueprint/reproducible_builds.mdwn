# Why we want reproducible builds

## List of reasons why

<div class="note">

Reproducible builds probably will not give us <emph>all</emph> these
advantages for free: some require additional work. Also, it might be
that some of these advantages are incompatible with each other.

</div>

* Allow independent verification that a build product matches what the
  source intended to produce ⇒ better resist attacks against build
  machines and developers (see
  <https://reproducible-builds.org/docs/buy-in/> for specific
  examples) ⇒ improves users' security, and allows developers to sleep
  better at night (as the incentive for an attacker to compromise
  developers' systems, or to compromise developers themselves, is
  lowered). In turn, this avoids the need to trust
  people (or software) who build the ISO we release, which in turn
  allows more people to get involved in release management work.

* We would not have to upload the ISO image when we do a release, we
  could instead build it on our infrastructure (Jenkins), build it
  locally, compare the outputs, and publish the ISO built by Jenkins
  if they match. Uploading an ISO can take many hours with
  some commonly found access to the Internet, so removing the need to
  go through this step decreases our time to remediation
  for fixing security issues, and makes it easier for developers
  with poor access to the Internet to take care of a release.

* Decrease the size of the IUKs ⇒ decrease the download time when
  upgrading ⇒ nicer UX, and makes it more likely that users upgrade in
  a timely manner instead of postponing to "when they have time".
  This depends e.g. on how we handle building with a fixed timestamp,
  and how we handle files metadata such as mtime when building an IUK.

* Limit the scope of the QA work that we have to conduct before
  putting out a bugfix release that has a small delta at the source
  level ⇒ decrease time to remediation (compared to having to test
  everything), and we can release security upgrades more frequently
  (e.g. every time a DSA affects us) because it is cheaper. We are
  indeed able to assess the impact of a specific update, when we know
  that everything else won't change when we build an ISO that includes
  this update, and we can verify it for example with diffoscope.

* No more bit flip that makes us waste precious hours during a release
  process (been there, seen that).

* Increases confidence in the value of our continuous quality
  assurance processes: it tests something that is be closer to what
  lands into the released binaries.

* Allow developers to use different build environments, while making
  sure that they produce the same binaries from the same source code.
  This is nice for developers (who get to pick their preferred tools),
  and also it helps ensure that we don't fully rely a golden trusted
  build environment, that must be absolutely never be compromised, and
  is very painful to upgrade.

* Increases the trust that users, and anyone interested really, can
  put into our released build products (such as ISO images) and our
  development and release process.

* Provides a more baseline (system + configuration) that is more
  stable, and thus it is easier to maintain a delta against it, and
  easier to audit that delta in the ISO built from the modified
  source; e.g. another flavour of Tails we would support ourselves, or
  a rebranded Tails produced by some NGO, or a personal, custom built
  ISO that differs only by the addition of a few packages.

* Might save disk space on mirrors, if some block-level de-duplication
  is done by the filesystem, and the compression algorithms we use to
  build images is stable enough in the situations we use it for.

* Opens the door for cross-architecture building and verification of the build
  products, which:
  - decreases the risk that our build systems are all affected by the
    same architecture- or platform- specific security issue;
  - may allow us to support more architectures (e.g.
    [[!tails_ticket 10972 desc="ARM"]]), because we could do most our
    CI and QA on the fastest one.

* Detect bugs, for example the ones provided on the
  [reproducible builds project's buy-in page](https://reproducible-builds.org/docs/buy-in/)
  (retrieved on 2015-02-16):
  "[[!debbug 773916 desc="a library had a different application binary interface for every build"]],
  [[!debbug 801855 desc="garbled strings due to encoding mismatch"]],
  [[!debbug 778486 desc="missing translations"]],
  or [[!debbug 778707 desc="changing dependencies"]]".

* "The constraint of having to reflect about the build environment
  also helps developers to think about the relationship with external
  software or data providers. Relying on external sources with no
  backup plans might cause serious troubles in the long term"
  ([reproducible builds project's buy-in page](https://reproducible-builds.org/docs/buy-in/), 2015-02-16).

* Faster development processes: e.g. when one knows for sure that
  build stage 1 will produce the same output, one can cache it and
  build only stages 2 to n.

## Draft

<div class="note">

This draft needs to be updated. It was written in 2014, way before we
came up with the previous list of advantages, or discussed this topic
much. It was primarily meant to explain why we needed
a [[!tails_ticket 5926 desc="freezable APT repository"]], as a first
step towards reproducible builds.

</div>

Being free software is a necessary condition for tools to
be trusted for their security. The only way for *security researchers*
to know if a piece of software is trustworthy, is to audit its source
code.

But operating systems are delivered *to their users* in binary form that
cannot be simply reverted back to their original source code.

Of course, we provide ways for our users to strongly authenticate our
binaries using HTTPS and OpenPGP signatures. But there is no technical
way for security researchers to be sure that the binary delivered to the
users was built from the original source code, because the process of
transforming the source code into a binary is not deterministic: for
various reasons, compiling the same source code twice produces
different binaries.

Several free software projects such as Tor, Debian, and Bitcoin are
working on addressing this core issue of secure computing by making the
build process deterministic using new, innovative techniques.

Tails also wants to work towards reproducible
builds, in order to enable security researchers to audit our software more easily
and, as a consequence, to allow our users to put more trust in our
software.

* Making POT files more stable: debconf 1.5.58's changelog entry reads
  "Don't update po/debconf.pot unless doing so changes something other than
  the POT-Creation-Date header.  The basic approach here is from gettext,
  though implemented a bit more simply since we can assume perl."
