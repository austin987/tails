The persistence feature for additional software packages is a great tool
to make Tails more flexible for diverse scenarios without having to
bloat the ISO image.

The current limitations include:

  - No user interface. Currently you have to edit a file as root. ([[!tails_ticket 5996 desc="#5996"]])

  - Their Installation locks the opening of the desktop. ([[!tails_ticket 9059 desc="#9059"]])

  - They are checked for updates every time Tor is restarted. ([[!tails_ticket 9819 desc="#9819"]])

We are going to implement this feature for Tails 3.7 ([[!tails_ticket 9059 desc="#14593"]])


Notes
=====

- Extract additional software lines from WhisperBack reports:

      sed -i -n -e '/live-additional-software.conf =====$/,/^=====/{ /^=====/d; p; }'
