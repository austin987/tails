Background
==========

Tails currently [[uses only AppArmor for isolating
applications|contribute/design/application_isolation]].

User namespaces eventually made their way into the 3.8 kernel:
<https://lwn.net/Articles/531114/>.

Threat model
============

These are *potential* goals. It remains to be discussed which ones are
MUST, SHOULD, etc., which can vary depending on the
sandboxed application.

* filesystem isolation?
* X isolation? (e.g. key logging, taking pictures of the screen)
* network isolation?
* privilege escalation via holes in Linux?
* privilege escalation via already running privileged daemons, or
  setuid/setgid binaries?
* isolation from hardware?
  - sound: prevent sandboxed software from recording
  - identifiers: prevent sandboxed software from learning hardware
    identifiers, e.g. the MAC address; probably hard to achieve, since
    containers share the host's kernel

Security limitations
====================

* Until we can use Ubuntu's AppArmor profiles for LXC in Debian (most
  notably, the mount mediation support is missing), privileged
  containers still [seem to be
  unsafe](https://www.stgraber.org/2014/01/01/lxc-1-0-security-features/).
* [Unprivileged
  containers](https://www.stgraber.org/2014/01/17/lxc-1-0-unprivileged-containers/)
  should be enough for most of what we intend to contain. It's unclear
  if they can be made to work on Debian Wheezy (seems to require quite
  some backporting work). Note, however, that unprivileged containers
  have had quite some security issues when they were introduced (and
  for this reason, the grsec patchset disables unprivileged use of
  user namespaces). Have things gotten better since?


Tools to manage containers
==========================

* LXC
* `unshare(1)`
* [pflask](https://github.com/ghedo/pflask) automates the creation of
  simple Linux containers based on them; it is e.g. used by
  [pflask-debuild](https://github.com/ghedo/pflask/blob/master/tools/pflask-debuild)
* systemd-nspawn
* Docker, that we're [[evaluating|blueprint/evaluate_Docker]] as
  a candidate to replace Vagrant in our easy build system

Running GUI applications in containers
======================================

We're told that Subgraph OS will use LXC + xpra. In this vein:

* <http://pleonasm.info/blog/2012/10/privilege-separation-with-xpra/>
* [docker-desktop](https://github.com/rogaha/docker-desktop)
* Stéphane Graber's [LXC 1.0 blog post
  series](https://www.stgraber.org/2013/12/20/lxc-1-0-blog-post-series/),
  and especially [GUI in
  containers](https://www.stgraber.org/2014/02/09/lxc-1-0-gui-in-containers/)
