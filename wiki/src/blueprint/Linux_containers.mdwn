Background
==========

User namespaces eventually made their way into the 3.8 kernel:

Tools to manage containers
==========================

* LXC
* `unshare(1)`
* [pflask](https://github.com/ghedo/pflask) automates the creation of
  simple Linux containers based on them; it is e.g. used by
  [pflask-debuild](https://github.com/ghedo/pflask/blob/master/tools/pflask-debuild)
* systemd-nspawn
* Docker, that we're [[evaluating|blueprint/evaluate_Docker]] as
  a candidate to replace Vagrant in our easy build system

Running GUI applications in containers
======================================

We're told that Subgraph OS will use LXC + xpra. In this vein:

* <http://pleonasm.info/blog/2012/10/privilege-separation-with-xpra/>
* [docker-desktop](https://github.com/rogaha/docker-desktop)
* Stéphane Graber's [LXC 1.0 blog post
  series](https://www.stgraber.org/2013/12/20/lxc-1-0-blog-post-series/),
  and especially [GUI in
  containers](https://www.stgraber.org/2014/02/09/lxc-1-0-gui-in-containers/)

===============

* <http://doger.io/> documents in details the current state of Linux
  containers (namespaces) and of the various userspace implementations
