Due to various concerns, Trecrypt is about to be replaced in Tails,
either by tcplay or cryptsetup.

This is the blueprint for [[!tails_ticket 5373]] and subtasks.

# Candidate alternatives

## Tc-play

[tc-play](https://github.com/bwalex/tc-play) is a Free implementation
of TrueCrypt based on dm-crypt, licensed under the 2-clause BSD license.
It is in Debian sid ([[!debpts tcplay]]), and would serve as a full
replacement of TrueCrypt... once a proper GUI available.

## Cryptsetup

[Cryptsetup 1.6 supports reading the TrueCrypt
on-disk format](https://code.google.com/p/cryptsetup/wiki/Cryptsetup160),
so if/when udisks and friends are adapted (if needed), then we could
as well avoid shipping any additional software at all. It is part of
Debian Jessie.

Once unlocked on the command-line, the TC volume shows up in Nautilus,
but no udisks / GNOME Disks / Nautilus integration is here to enable
the user to graphically activate a TC volume.

Upstream (udisks) feature request:
<https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=70164>

## Zulucrypt

[zuluCrypt](https://code.google.com/p/zulucrypt) is a front end to cryptsetup
and tcplay, it make easy to manage Truecrypt
volumes through a GUI, but it's not packaged in Debian yet
([[!debbug 703911 desc="RFP #703911"]]).
