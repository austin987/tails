Documentation and website
=========================

- We completely rewrote the documentation on [[virtualization|doc/advanced_topics/virtualization]]. It now makes it clearer what is virtualization, what are the [[security implications|doc/advanced_topics/virtualization#security]] and provides detailed instructions on how to setup Tails in [[VirtualBox|doc/advanced_topics/virtualization/virtualbox]], [[virt-manager|doc/advanced_topics/virtualization/virt-manager]], and [[GNOME Boxes|doc/advanced_topics/virtualization/boxes]], either straight from ISO, from a [[physical USB stick|doc/advanced_topics/virtualization/virt-manager#usb]], or from a [[virtual USB stick|doc/advanced_topics/virtualization/virt-manager#virtual_usb]].

- We explained the risks of [[accessing internal
  hard|doc/encryption_and_privacy/your_data_wont_be_saved_unless_explicitly_asked]]
  disks from Tails.

Press & Testimonials
====================

Four major french-speaking medias (Le Monde, La Libre Belgique, Le Soir de Bruxelles and RTBF - radio-télévision belge) have launched [Source Sûre](https://sourcesure.eu/), a whistleblowing platform, in french, that uses Tails.

UX
==

- We discussed a solution for a [[screen
  locker|blueprint/screen_locker]] that could be reused by other live
  distributions.

- We [reviewed](https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/8235#note-11) the
  latest mockups of the [[new Tails Greeter|blueprint/greeter_revamp_UI]]
  with usability experts.

- We analyzed in depth the process for new users to [[get started with
  Tails|blueprint/bootstrapping]] and made plans to adjust the relevant
  tools ([[Tails Installer|blueprint/bootstrapping/installer]],
  [[browser extension|blueprint/bootstrapping/extension]], [[Tails
  Upgrader|blueprint/bootstrapping/upgrade]], and [[web
  assistant|blueprint/bootstrapping/assistant]]).
