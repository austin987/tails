What's the problem
------------------

some ideas/suggestions:

*  Can we measure how severe the problem is? 

    ` find $WIKIPATH -name *.de.po -type f -exec \
     grep -ioE "Nutzer|Anwender|$MOREWORDS" '{}' \; | wc -l `

   That could allow us to decide whether we have an urgent problem in
   our documentation that needs to be addressed in general, or whether
   it occurs only in a few places that can be fixed manually by
   slightly twisting the language.

*  Via the same approach as we handle other translation issues: How do
   other wikis/translations handle the same problem? Like TorProject,
   GNOME, Debian, Wikipedia,...  What would be the "official" (Duden?)
   way to do it? (for comparison)

*  Other languages are not gender neutral as well. How is it handled in
   the French/$MORELANG translation?
   Of course it is difficult to compare "good" and "bad" languages with
   regard to gender neutrality, and every language needs a mechanism to
   express/discriminate between, for instance, gender where it is
   necessary for understanding.

*  It should be decided what we want to achieve: non-discrimination
   between which groups?  A candidate/idea for a solution should again
   be evaluated for this aspect.  For instance if we decided to use
   "Benutzerinnen und Benutzer" consistently, we might accidentially
   exclude all groups that don't want themselves to be categorised to
   male or female.  We could bite the bullet and accept that we cannot
   fix natural/spoken languages and need to take a feasible option.
   Another approach could be to only remove/replace words (versus
   adding them) to make the language less specific, and thus, less
   discriminating. (On the other hand, there are some people that are
   very effective in saying nothing with a lot of words.)

Examples of sentences and their german translation
--------------------------------------------------

"Das Hauptziel einer Fehlerbeschreibung ist es, den Entwicklern genau
zu sagen wie der Fehler reproduziert werden kann." from the bug
reporting page. In this situation we could use "den Entwickelnden"
oder a gender gap "den Entwickler*Innen". The question is also how we
can maintain a good readability (for me personally a gender gap is not
a problem for readability, it's sort of a habituation thing).

Another example:
"Das Ziel dieser Dokumentation ist zu erklären, wie man Tails benutzt
und dem Nutzer die wesentlichen Sicherheitsfeatures darzustellen."
from the introduction page. In this one we could use "den Nutzenden",
but this sounds a bit weird. So maybe a gender gap fits more in here
or a completely different term.

Last example (there a a lot of them ;) I just picked some out quickly):
"Tor wird gleichermaßen von Journalisten, Strafverfolgungsbehörden,
Regierungen, Menschenrechtsaktivisten, Geschäftsführern, dem Militär,
Missbrauchsopfern und normalen Bürgern, die sich um ihre Privatsphäre
sorgen, benutzt." from  "Why does Tails use Tor?"

Why do we want gender neutral language?
---------------------------------------

* discrimination is not only done by excluding "different" (or not being the norm) marginalized groups physically, by law etc.
 - language itself is often only adressing male persons. different languages have distinct pronouns etc.
* we consider that we don't want to exclude or patronize any person (as stated in our Code of Conduct), we want to address any person (free from any prejudice, etc.), this also concerns language, as language itself is reproducing, re-enabling and reinforcing and thus portraying a (current) society where various marginalized groups are discriminated
* we understand that gender neutral language can be in fact more complicated and may appear a bit more clumsy than "usual" language. but we also believe that language is nothing what is set in stone, it evolves permanently and is adapted to new needs. new words are introduced nearly every day and other words are used less frequently, sometimes even words and phrases disappear (and perhaps reappear someday again)
* the current state-of-the-art language does not have to be taken for granted. every single person is in the position to reflect, modify and adapt language
* as many non-discriminated persons don't recognize their privileged positions and have to learn what their privileges are and how discrimination is carried out towards affected groups, most people do not recognize the discriminating power of language. 
* language is not only a tool. language is varied in terms of style, wording and grammar when addressing distinct groups (scientific papers, [technical] documentation, essays, personal letters/e-mails, chat, short messaging etc.). it also carries underlying (societal) structures, authority, social status, rights, adressing and meanings that represent (sometimes even decades to century old) societal structures and a society which is based on oppression and institutional discrimination (colonization, racism, patriarchy, two-gendered-heterosexist norms and structures, etc)
* often people tell that "this was not meant this way", "by using $this (male)-gendered wording we address everyone". this is not enough, as inclusion does not happen by the "will to include", but in the same sentence not addressing particular groups. it's even worse to say so, as it implies that you understand the concerns wrt. discriminating language, but you're ignoring solutions for them for some reasons ("better readability", "adds a layer of complexity", "it is and should not be our task to address this", "it won't change anything wrt. discrimination and inclusion of marginalized groups", "everybody knows that 'all' are meant by using $expression", etc.)

Possible in-practice solutions
---------------------

* add a "disclaimer" that we address everyone and that we understand the general problem but use common wording as it's less complicated. -> aka. leave as it is
* use both female/male wording, e.g. "Benutzerinnen und Benutzer".
* switch around between e.g. male and female
* "internal I" aka Binnen-I
* "Gendergap" and variants (underscore, asterisk, small/operator asterisk, period. e.g. "Benutzer_innen", "Benutzer﹡innen", "Benutzer∗innen", "Benutzer.innen")
* "Gender-x" abolish gender completely and replace it by an "x" or "ces", e.g. "Benutzx" resp. "Benutzecs"
