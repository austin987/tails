Rationale
=========

In [[!tails_ticket 9264]], we're discussing and drafting our needs for more
isotesters. From some statistics of the number of automated builds per month,
we concluded we need to be able to run at least 1000 more test suites per
month, which means being able to host at least 8 more isotesters.

Note: our workload parallelizes poorly over multiple CPU cores, so
perhaps getting _less_ additional ISO testers, but each with faster
CPU clock, would be more efficient.

Estimates
=========

As a reminder, we are discussing in [[!tails_ticket 10396]] that one
isotester means:

 * 20G RAM
 * 25G HDD (10G system+data, 15G tmp)
 * 3 CPU threads

So 8 isotesters would mean:

 * 160G RAM
 * 200G HDD
 * 24 CPU threads max

From there, it seems unlikely we could host that on Lizard, and we are
back on the research about new hardware for isotesters.

Hardware
========

Given the amount of RAM and CPUs required, it seems close to [[Lizard's
specs|blueprint/hardware_for_automated_tests]].

We still need to decide if we would use faster (as in Ghz) CPUs than the one
Lizard has (Low voltages versions). In this case the price jumps quite a bit,
and the electic bill will too (120W each for that kind of CPUs, against the 65W
each of Lizard's ones).

The following price estimations are based on interpromicro.com ones.

## Candidate options

We currently prefer option C if it's doable, and option D otherwise.

### Option C: 12 cores, upgradable by adding a CPU

XXX:

* can we plug one CPU only on a 2-sockets SMP mobo?
  => ask taggart
* this is for 8 VMs with 3 vcpus each; if we can instead go for 4 VMs
  with 3 real cores each, then we need less RAM (~ $1000 less)
  => depends on the outcome of [[!tails_ticket 10971]]

 * 1 x Super X10DRi, 2x GB/i350 LAN, 10x SATA3(C612)+R, IPMI, DDR4(1TB) - $390
 * 1 x Intel® E5-2690v3-2.6Ghz/12C, 30M, 135W LGA2011 CPU               - $2124
 * 16 x 16GB D4-2133Mhz, ECC/Reg 288-Pin Sdram                          - $2100
 * 2 x Samsung 850 EVO, 500GB 2.5" SATA3 SSD(3D V-NAMD)                 - $400
 * 1 x Heatsink                                                         - $50
 * 1 x Supermicro SC113TQ-600W, 1U RM, WIO, 8x 2.5" SAS/SATA 600W       - $350

Total   --- **$5424**

### Option D: 2*6 cores, upgradable by replacing CPUs

XXX:

* this is for 8 VMs with 3 vcpus each; if we can instead go for 4 VMs
  with 3 real cores each, then we need less RAM (~ $1000 less)
  => depends on the outcome of [[!tails_ticket 10971]]

 * 1 x Super X10DRi, 2x GB/i350 LAN, 10x SATA3(C612)+R, IPMI, DDR4(1TB) - $390
 * 2 x Intel® E5-2643v3, 6C, 3.4GHz, 135                                - $3260
 * 16 x 16GB D4-2133Mhz, ECC/Reg 288-Pin Sdram                          - $2100
 * 2 x Samsung 850 EVO, 500GB 2.5" SATA3 SSD(3D V-NAMD)                 - $400
 * 1 x Heatsink                                                         - $50
 * 1 x Supermicro SC113TQ-600W, 1U RM, WIO, 8x 2.5" SAS/SATA 600W       - $350

Total   --- **$6675**

## Deprecated options

### Option A: Low voltage CPUs

We actually need less CPU cores.

That's essentially a Lizard clone, minus SSD HDDs.

 * 1 x Supermicro SC113TQ-600W, 1U RM, WIO, 8x 2.5" SAS/SATA 600W       - $350

Total   --- **$6200**

### Option B: Faster CPUs

## Ways to lower the price a bit

No need to invest time into it immediately, but if we eventually decide
to go this way and the total price is a bit too high, we should look
into these options.

### Less RAM

Here, we pay for the test suite's temporary storage twice: once in RAM
(disk cache managed by the kernel), once on disk. We could cut down on
costs a bit by not buying all the corresponding RAM now, and instead
relying purely on the SSDs (buy 128GB instead of 256GB for the new
machine, which saves ~$1k).

I'm curious what would be the performance hit if we did that. I guess
it's easy enough to get a first very rough estimate (just give an
isotesterN 10GB of RAM instead of 20GB, or something), but really it all
depends on how the drives handle _multiple_ instances of the test suite
writing/reading tons of data.
