[[!toc levels=2]]

Rationale
=========

In [[!tails_ticket 9264]], we're discussing and drafting our needs for more
isotesters. From some statistics of the number of automated builds per month,
we concluded we need to be able to run at least 1000 more test suites per
month.

Note: our workload parallelizes poorly over multiple CPU cores per ISO tester,
so we need to get more ISO testers and/or ISO testers with faster CPU clock.

Estimates
=========

As a reminder, one isotester means:

 * at least 20 GiB RAM, preferably 23 GiB
 * 25G HDD (10G system+data, 15G tmp)
 * 3 CPU threads

XXX: update this with the results from [[!tails_ticket 11109]].

On [[!tails_ticket 9264]] we concluded that we want to be able to run the test
suite 1350 times per month. Each of our current isotesters on lizard v2 can run
it about 120 times a month. We have four such VMs => we can already cope with
480 times a month => we need to find out how to run it 1350 - 480 = 870 more
times a month (2.81 times more than what we currently can do).

# Upgrading lizard v2

We are seriously under-using lizard v2's CPU power. Let's try to fix this in
a way that solves at least part of the performance problems we currently have:
[[!tails_ticket 9264]] and [[!tails_ticket 10999]].

Experiments conducted on [[!tails_ticket 10996]] showed that we can probably
run the test suite 25-35% more times on lizard, if we gave it 49 GiB more RAM
and run 6 isotesters with 23 GiB RAM each. This brings us to something between
480 * 1.25 = 600 and 480 * 1.35 = 648 runs a month. It might be that we can even
run 8 isotesters efficiently, given 95 GiB more RAM than we currently have, but
let's not count on it.

This still covers only about half of our needs. So we'll need a second machine
to host more ISO testers at some point: see below.

Also, as seen on [[!tails_ticket 10999]], we could make use of more
ISO builders, and here again, lizard could cope with this workload if we gave it
18 more GiB of RAM.

So, giving lizard 48+18 = 66 or 95+18 = 113 GiB more RAM would fix part of the
problems we currently have, use more of our currently available computing power
(which would be satisfying in itself), and teach us lots of things about how to
set up and optimize systems to cope with our ISO testing workload.

IMO (intrigeri) this would allow us to more cleverly pick hardware for the
second ISO testing machine when we come to it. I think we should go with the
higher option (which means upgrading to 256 GiB of RAM), that gives us more
flexibility to experiment with various numbers of ISO builders and testers, and
worst case RAM would always be useful for running more services we're asked to
set up, and for improving performance thanks to disk caches.

⇒ this was done ([[!tails_ticket 11010]]): lizard now has 256 GB of
RAM, which allowed us to work on subtasks of [[!tails_ticket 11009]],
starting with [[!tails_ticket 11113]].

# A second machine

**Note**: IMO (intrigeri) we should experiment on lizard with more RAM
before we make the final decision here, but this should not block us from
drafting possible solutions :)

For reference, see [[lizard's specs|blueprint/hardware_for_automated_tests]].

Assuming we have upgraded lizard as explained above, we need a second machine
able to run the test suite about 700-750 times a month. If each ISO tester on
that second machine was exactly as fast as those we have on lizard, then we
would need 6 ISO testers on the new machine. But it's not a given: we can
probably get faster ISO testers on the new machine; how many ISO testers it will
run, and how many CPU cores and how much RAM it needs, depends on how fast each
CPU core is. Economically speaking, faster CPU cores can save money on RAM
(because we can achieve the same throughput with fewer ISO testers), but they
cost more in electricity.

The following price estimates are based on <http://interpromicro.com/> ones.

## Candidate options

**Note**: the following selection of candidates is outdated, as it doesn't take
into account the most recent developments on this topic (see above). E.g. 4-6
new ISO testers will probably be enough, and in turn we may be instead looking
for something like:

* 128 GiB of RAM (ideally we would just reuse the 128 GiB we have in lizard v2)
* 12-18 CPU threads == 6-9 CPU cores

# Benchmarks

This is about [[!tails_ticket 11011]], [[!tails_ticket 11009]] and
friends. All these tests are run on lizard v2, and all isobuilders we
have (currently: 2) must be kept busy while tests are running.

The initial set of tests use `ext4` for `/tmp/TailsToaster`, and later
on we switch to `tmpfs`.

* past baseline: 4 tests in parallel, with 20GB of RAM for each tester
  - rationale: get an idea of whether giving testers more RAM helped
  - results: 72 minutes / run, 3.3 runs / hour

* current baseline: 4 tests in parallel, with 23GB of RAM for each tester
  - rationale: get an idea of whether giving testers more RAM helped;
    and provide a current baseline to compare other results with
  - results: 69 minutes / run, 3.5 runs / hour
  - conclusion: giving more RAM to each isotester seems to help a bit;
    next benchmarks will all use 23 GB per isotester

* more vcpus per TailsToaster: 4 test suite runs in parallel, with
  23GB of RAM for each tester, from the experimental branch
  - rationale: see if [[!tails_ticket 6729]] helps
  - results: 65 minutes / run, 3.7 runs / hour
  - conclusion: this hypothesis is worth looking more closely into,
    so next benchmarks will be run with both 1 and 2 vpcus per
    TailsToaster

And then, we can work on [[!tails_ticket 11113]]:

* 6 testers: 6 tests (devel branch, 1 vcpu per TailsToaster)
  in parallel on 6 testers, with 23GB of RAM for each tester
  - results: 3/6 runs fail, 2 of them due to [[!tails_ticket 10777]],
    another one due to a kernel panic in TailsToaster

* 6 testers: 6 tests (experimental branch, 2 vcpus per TailsToaster)
  in parallel on 6 testers, with 23GB of RAM for each tester
  - results: 3/6 runs fail
    * two failures due to a mistake in test/10777-robust-boot-menu,
      fixed since then in commit 4601cbb
    * one due to a regression probably brought by
      test/10777-robust-boot-menu, fixed since then in commit 6a9030a;
      plus some race condition in the "all notifications have
      disappeared" step

At this point it seems that I/O load is a problem (it slows down
things enough to trigger weird test failures), so let's switch to
mounting a tmpfs on `/tmp/TailsToaster` ([[!tails_ticket 11175]]) for
all following benchmarks.

* 6 testers: 6 tests (devel branch, 1 vcpu per TailsToaster)
  in parallel on 6 testers, with 23GB of RAM for each tester
  - results #1: 59 minutes, 6.1 runs / hour;
    one failure due to [[!tails_ticket 11176]], and another one that
    I can't quite explain; note that I was setting up VMs with Puppet
    during this run
  - results #2: 58.8 minutes / run, 6.1 runs / hour

* 6 testers: 6 tests (experimental branch, 2 vcpus per TailsToaster)
  in parallel on 6 testers, with 23GB of RAM for each tester
  - results #1: 49 minutes, 7.3 runs / hour;
    one failure due to a mistake in test/10777-robust-boot-menu,
    fixed since then; note that I was installing Debian on 2 VMs
    during this run
  - results #2: 75 minutes (?!); one failure due to kernel panic in
    TailsToaster
  - results #3: 50.3 minutes / run, 7.2 runs / hour

* 8 testers: 8 tests (devel branch, 1 vcpu per TailsToaster)
  in parallel on 8 testers, with 23GB of RAM for each tester
  - results #1: 58.5 minutes / run, 8.2 runs / hour
  - results #2: 60.2 minutes / run, 7.8 runs / hour

* 8 testers: 8 tests (experimental branch, 2 vcpus per TailsToaster)
  in parallel on 8 testers, with 23GB of RAM for each tester
  - results #1: 51 minutes / run, 9.5 runs / hour; 2 failures due to
    [[!tails_ticket 10777]]
  - results #2: XXX
