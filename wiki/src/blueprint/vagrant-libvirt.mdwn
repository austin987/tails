# Installation

This is currently easiest to set up (to avoid backporting, see below)
on a Debian Sid box with libvirt installed:

    sudo apt-get install vagrant
    vagrant plugin install vagrant-libvirt

After this, the Tails branch `feature/vagrant-libvirt` makes
everything work like when Vagrant was using Virtualbox, except basebox
building (see below).

# Issues (and their workarounds) with vagrant-libvirt

## Packaging

`vagrant-libvirt` is not packaged in Debian yet, so we need to RFP it,
and then have it backported to Wheezy.

Also, some of `vagrant-libvirt`'s dependencies are too old in Wheezy:

* `ruby-fog >= 1.10.0`: Sid has 1.12.1 and backporting is trivial
  (i.e. just rebuild in a Wheezy chroot).
* `vagrant >= 1.1`: Sid has 1.2.2, backporting is trivial but also
  requires packporting the follwing dependencies:
  - `ruby-childprocess >= 0.3.7`: Sid has 0.3.9 and backporting is
    trivial.
  - `ruby-net-scp >= 1.1.0`: Sid has 1.1.1 and backporting is almost
    trivial; tests are failing due to errors loading `ruby-mocha`.
    This can probably be fixed in
    `debian/patches/disable-rubygems-in-tests.patch` by requiring
    `mocha` instead of `mocha/setup` or similar (see the difference
    between this patch in the Wheezy and Sid sources). It of course
    builds if tests are disabled (i.e. `DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=nocheck`).
  - `ruby-net-ssh >= 2.6.6`: Sid has 2.6.8, and backporting is
    identical to backporting `ruby-net-scp`, described above.

## Syncing (Tails' Git and built images)

When using the libvirt provider in Vagrant, "synced folders" are
simply `rsync`:ed into the VM's filesystem, unlike with Vagrant with
Virtualbox, which uses its shared folder feature. The `rsync:`ing only
happens at VM start (not at VM stop; Vagrant specifies this as legit
behaviour, so it's not a bug), so any changes made to Tails' git after
that are not pulled into `/amnesia.git` (a VM restart is required),
and the built image can't be synced to the host using `/vagrant`
(remember, syncing back to host never happens). The current
implementation therefore doesn't rely on synced folders but instead:

* manually uploads Tails' git before starting the build using
  Vagrant's upload feature.
* manually downloads the built image after building is complete
  using Vagrant's download feature.

Proper synced folders (bidirectional, continously "syncing", like
Virtualbox' shared folders) would be preferable (faster, less disk
usage (size of Tails' .git) in build guest, less code complexity,
etc.), so we'd like this
[upstream issue](https://github.com/pradels/vagrant-libvirt/issues/7)
to get fixed.

It should be noted that the libvirt provider does support shares using
NFS, which would give synced folders with the properties we want, but
this requires configuring an NFS server on the host box, which makes
this approach too complicated.

## Get rid of the Vagrant "verified downloads" monkeypatch

We monkeypatch Vagrant to verify the integrity of the downloaded
basebox in `vagrant/lib/vagrant_verified_download.rb`. Due to heavy
code reorganizing of Vagrant beween 1.0.x and 1.2.x, the monkeypatch
isn't very pretty or convenient any more. Although the current one
works, it's very fragile, but so are monkeypatches in general. A
proper patch has been written and submitted upstream
([issue](https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/issues/1124), [pull
request](https://github.com/tails-developers/vagrant/pull/1)) and, if
accepted, we hopefully can get the next Vagrant containing the patch
backported to Wheezy.

## Basebox building

The squeeze definition on Tails branch `feature/vagrant-libvirt` can
be successfully built using KVM (`veewee kvm build squeeze`) with the
current release of `veewee` (0.3.7, installed per our
[[current instructions|contribute/design/vagrant]]), but:

* `veewee kvm export` is not implemented.
* the box image is created in the `raw` format, so it consumes the
  full 10 GiB disk space, and is incompatible with `vagrant-libvirt`,
  which only supports `qcow2`.

Both of these issues are fixed in `veewee`'s Git, but getting it to
run/install brought gem dependency hell onto my machine, so I've been
unable to test it. Hopefully this will be easier after next realse (so
there's a Ruby gem). Having the next version of `veewee` in Debian
(and backported to Wheezy) would of course be ideal
([RFP](http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=658863)).

Until a `vagrant-libvirt`-compatible `veewee` is released, basebox
building won't be fully automatic using `rake` any more. One will have
to pick either of steps `1.{a,b,c}` below to create a disk image, and
then step `2` to package it into a `.box` (personally I went with
`1c + 2` as that doesn't require any fiddling with Ruby gems):

### 1.a How to fix images built with veewee 0.3.7 using KVM

For now we can manually convert the `raw` image created by `veewee`
like this (note: `squeeze.img` below can be found in your libvirt pool's
directory):

    qemu-img convert -c -O qcow2 squeeze.img box.img

### 1.b How to fix images built with veewee using Virtualbox

Since Virtualbox currently is better supported (both be `veewee` and
our Rakefile) this may be an easier approach. The disk image can be
extracted from the exported `.box` with `tar xf` (or `tar xzf`), and
if we assume it's named `box.vmdk` we can make it compatible with
`vagrant-libvirt` like this:

    qemu-img convert -c -O qcow2 box.vmdk box.img

### 1.c How to fix our old squeeze.box

We can actually use the disk image `box-disk1.vmdk` from our
[old `squeeze.box`](http://dl.amnesia.boum.org/tails/project/vagrant/squeeze.box),
unpack it with `tar xf`). While libvirt/KVM supports the vmdk format I
recommend converting it to a better supported one (I/O errors are
common in libvirt/KVM when using vmdk):

    qemu-img convert -c -O qcow2 box-disk1.vmdk box-disk1.img

Next, setup a `x86_64` domain in libvirt and boot it with a virtual
hard drive backed by `box-disk1.img`, and install the new
dependencies, which actually only is `rsync`, and while we're at it we
might just as well update the system and take steps to reduce the
image size:

    unset HISTFILE
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get upgrade
    sudo apt-get install rsync
    sudo apt-get remove virtualbox*
    sudo apt-get autoremove
    sudo apt-get clean
    sudo rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
    sudo rm -f /var/lib/dhcp/*.leases
    sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/EMPTY bs=1M
    sudo rm -f /EMPTY
    date | sudo tee /etc/vagrant_box_build_time
    sudo halt

Note that even though our `box-disk1.img` is in `qcow2` format
already, we want to re-convert it using `qemu-img` to reduce the image
size (that's why we run `dd` in the VM above):

    qemu-img convert -c -O qcow2 box-disk1.img box.img

### 2 How to package the .box

This is how we package `box.img` from any of the previous steps into a
`vagrant-libvirt`-compatible `.box`:

    echo 'Vagrant.require_plugin "vagrant-libvirt"' > Vagrantfile
    cat > metadata.json << END
    {
      "provider"     : "libvirt",
      "format"       : "qcow2",
      "virtual_size" : 10
    }
    END
    tar czf squeeze-libvirt.box ./metadata.json  ./Vagrantfile ./box.img

To test it, temporarily set (overwriting existing values):

    config.vm.box_url = 'file:///path/to/squeeze-libvirt.box'
    config.vm.box_checksum = '<sha256 checksum of squeeze-libvirt.box>'

in `vagrant/Vagrantfile`.
