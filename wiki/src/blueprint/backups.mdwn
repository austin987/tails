[[!meta title="Backups of the persistent volume"]]

[[!toc  levels=2]]

We want to allow our users to backup the data they have in their persistent
volume.

See the thread on tails-dev:

<https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2014-April/005388.html>

Backup techniques
=================

We shouldn't maintain yet another shiny new piece of code to do that. Or we
might hit tons of corner cases to handle, that one initially does not think of.
And once we take it all into account, then we get a large piece of code to
maintain all by ourselves, because it was meant only for Tails' needs.

So, we should try to reinvent this wheel, and use an existing, proven solution instead.

Tar + GPG
---------

A simple approach might be to combine tar and GPG:

    tar cjf - . | gpg --cipher-algo AES -c - > /home/amnesia/YYYY-MM-DD-backup.tbz2.gpg

Initial implementation might be easy but that will probably end up being quite a
big piece of custom code.

Duplicity
---------

<http://duplicity.nongnu.org/>

It supports something that's basically "tar | gpg" for the first iteration, and
it also leaves room for future improvements, thanks to its support for
incremental and remote backups. Also, it allows users to restore or inspect
their backups outside of Tails, without having to manually decipher yet another
backup file format.

Cons:

- Duplicity creates tons of messy files on the file system.

Loopback LUKS
-------------

Cons:

- We still need to find another tool to create the device and copy the files.
- Maybe backups done this way would be much bigger than duplicity backups.
- Duplicity supports incremental backups even if they have some limitations.

Pros:

- One file per backup.

Obnam
-----

Obnam only supports encrypting to a GnuPG key, so this would require another
layer of encryption (such as a LUKS container file, or something else) if we
want to support encrypting with a passphrase (and I think we should).

grsync + encrypted device
------------------------------

[grsync](http://www.opbyte.it/grsync/) is a GUI for the renown and rock-solid `rsync`, already shipped in Tails.

Grsync is [packaged for debian](https://packages.debian.org/squeeze/grsync).

The documentation for the creation of the encrypted device [[is already written|doc/encryption_and_privacy/encrypted_volumes]].

**How to test?**

* create an encrypted device.
* install the `grsync` package.
* paste [those lines](http://chopapp.com/#twledfq4) in a `.grsync` file, then double-click on it.
  (grsync ask you first to confirm the profile you want to use. Just click on "Open")
* define the destination (i.e your encrypted device)
* test wildly!

**Todo**

* some files are normally not readable by rsync (for example persistence.conf, apt/*)
  Grsync can bypass that with the option "Run as superuser", we should investigate the consequences of using such an option.
* decide if we activate the option `--delete` by default.
* test restoration, then check files permissions.
* test backup + restoration with symlinks and hardlinks in the Persistent folder.
* eventually test remote backups.


Other solutions
---------------

We should investigate how others have already solved this problem.

User experience
===============

- The user should be prompted about where to save the backup as this will most
  probably end up directly on a storage device and not go through RAM.

- Ask the user which folders of the persistence setup to backup. But maybe
  that's not needed for a first prototype, as we might assume that the info in
  persistence is kept to the minimum.

- The restore step would do the current delete partition steps (if there was
  already a persistence partition found), then most of the current steps to
  create a partition, but instead of asking the user what they want to use their
  new partition for, it would instead ask the user to pick a backup and would
  restore it.  

- There could be a single menu entry called "Backup and restore persistent
  volume". Combining both actions in a single menu entry makes it clear that
  they are directly related, and limits the number of menu entries.

- There should be a graphical way to restore backups. It is important let
  non-techy users restore their backups if necessary.

Implementation
==============

- Avoid running the GUI as root and rather run the GUI as amnesia or a dedicated
  user and execute precise actions through policykit (execute a command with
  pkexec or implement a dbus service)

- Write the code in GTK3 for Tails 1.1 which will be the next major release,
  based on Debian Wheezy.
