[[!meta title="Tails report for August, 2015"]]

We're sorry it took us so long to publish this report. We'll publish
fresher news soon :)

The 16th of August was Tails 6th birthday. Well, Tails existed before, but it was the birthday of [the first public release](https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2009-August/002667.html). Actually, it was named amnesia then, it was before the fusion with Incognito.

Never mind the details. Let's celebrate!

[[!inline pages="inc/release_notes/1.5" raw="yes"]]

Documentation and website
=========================

* We finally found a good formulation about [[Tails not protecting against BIOS malware|doc/about/warning]].

* We documented [[the languages in which user support is available|support]].

* We reorganized information between the [[Start Tails|doc/first_steps/start_tails]] and the [[Tails does not start|doc/first_steps/bug_reporting/tails_does_not_start]] pages.

* We published an (incomplete) list of [[organizations doing Tails training|support/learn]].

* We documented how to workaround issues on [[switchable graphics computer|support/known_issues#switchable_graphics]].

* We explained better why we disabled the [[circuit view of Tor
  Browser|doc/anonymous_internet/Tor_Browser#torbutton]] in Tails.

* We explained why Tails had [[no antivirus software|support/faq#antivirus]].

* We explained how to analyse [[Wi-Fi problems with Broadcom interfaces|support/known_issues#wireless]].

User experience
===============

- On the [[Download and Verify|blueprint/bootstrapping/extension]] extension for Firefox:
  * sajolida sent an email to give the [status of our work](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2015-August/009447.html).
  * Giorgio Maone explained the [changes in the landscape of Firefox extensions](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2015-August/009450.html) and how they affect the technology that we can use.
  * Clarified what happens in case of an [interrupted download](https://labs.riseup.net/code/attachments/download/924/extension-20150828-resume.png).

- On the [[Installation Assistant|blueprint/bootstrapping/assistant]]:
  * We [[!tails_ticket 10047 desc="took decisions"]] from the testing of the
    Windows installation scenario that was tested in June.

Infrastructure
==============

* We asked our mirrors to disable HTTP ETag to better support resumed
  downloads and documented how to do that.

* Despite of the [Tor bug](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/11741)
  limiting our pool of HTTP mirrors is getting small. We need mirrors again and
  [[stopped saying that our pool is full|contribute/how/mirror#http]].

* Our test suite covers 191 scenarios, 6 more than in July.

Funding
=======

* We finally signed a contract with OTF, running from February 2015 to July
  2016, and sent our first report.

* We created ourselves a [Flattr account](https://flattr.com/submit/auto?user_id=tails_live&url=https://tails.boum.org&title=Tails).

Outreach
========

* [We have Tails stickers again](http://t.co/AgtuTN0XmJ)! We'll share them during upcoming events, you can also [[make your own|contribute/how/promote/material/stickers]].

* Alan attended [GUADEC, the GNOME conference](https://2015.guadec.org/) in Gothenburg, Sweden on August 7 – 9  and connected us better with the GNOME community.

* A talk about Tails took place during DebConf15 in Heidelberg, Germany, on August 15th.

* DrWhax did a lightning talk about Tails at [CCCamp](https://events.ccc.de/camp/2015/wiki/Main_Page) on August 13 - 17 in Zehdenick, Germany.

On-going discussions
====================

* Alan submitted for review a new version of
  [Tor Monitor](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2015-August/009381.html)
  (to replace Vidalia) and Sascha Steinbiss proposed to
  [package it for Debian](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2015-August/009397.html).

* We drafted a script to [[!tails_ticket 9993 desc="run a Mumble server"]] from
  Tails, verified that the Mumble client in Tails Jessie works well, and
  started using it for internal meetings.
