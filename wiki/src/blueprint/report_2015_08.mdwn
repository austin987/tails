[[!meta title="Tails report for August, 2015"]]

The 16th of August was Tails 6th birthday. Well, Tails existed before, but it was the birthday of [the first public release](https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2009-August/002667.html). Actually, it was named amnesia then, it was before the fusion with Incognito.

Nevermind the details. Let's celebrate :)
