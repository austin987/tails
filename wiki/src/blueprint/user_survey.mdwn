Questions from the Foundations Team
===================================

Research questions
------------------

### OpenPGP support outside of Thunderbird ([[!tails_ticket 8310]], [[!tails_ticket 17183]], [[!tails_ticket 17169]])

This will become an even hotter topic once Enigmail goes away in a few months:
Thunderbird will maintain its own keyring, independently from GnuPG's ⇒
Seahorse will stop being useful for anything related to email, so the
cost/benefit of vaguely supporting it will become even higher.

- **How popular is OpenPGP inside and outside Thunderbird?**
- **How technical are the people using OpenPGP outside Thunderbird?**
- **Could these people use Thunderbird instead?**
- **Who will suffer from the Thunderbird migration because they use
  OpenPGP both inside and outside Thundebird?**

### Can we stop including an IRC client by default? (#15816)

This open question has been the main blocker for replacing Pidgin for years.

- **What would be the cost of removing the support for IRC by default in Tails?**
- **How technical are the people using IRC in Tails?**
- **Are people using IRC in Tails to connect to servers that do not block Tor?**
- **How popular is XMPP among our users?**

### Notes

- Secure Drop mentions encrypting files with GPG went sending submissions:

### Prompt

Survey on **ease of use and online privacy tools**

**Contribute to Tails by answering these few questions!** (4&ndash;5 minutes)

To improve Tails we need to learn how people use it but, unlike
others, we don't track you against your will. Your answers are anonymous
and only our team can access the data.

### Conditional questions on OpenPGP or Pidgin

- **We might be interested in asking you a few more questions to
  understand better how you use OpenPGP or Pidgin in Tails. If you feel
  like it, you can share your email address with us. We will only use it
  to contact you as part of this research and delete it afterwards.**

I2P (#12264)
------------

It's unclear what we should tell nowadays to folks interested in re-adding I2P
support.

Research questions
==================

- Size of user base

  - How many users do we really have?
  - Right now we only have number of boots per day but combining this
    with how frequently people use Tails, we could extrapolate rough
    number of users and maybe usage categories (fraction of frequent
    users and occasional users, etc.).

- Technical skills

  - How technically skilled are our users?
  - How big is the difference between the technical skills of our target
    audience and real audience?
  - Is there a match between how hard Tails is to use and the skills of
    our actual users?

- Region

  - Is Tails useful and accessible by a global audience?
  - Information on where Tails is used the most is very helpful for
    fundraising, outreach, or translation efforts.

- Current features

  - What are people using Tails the most?
    This would help us clarify what are the most important features of
    Tails and prioritize incremental improvements.

- New features

  - How shall we prioritize our future plans?
  - What is missing the most in Tails?
    This would help us build a better roadmap.
