From the Tails UI, select Applications > Utilities > Screenshot

This will open up the Screenshot utility. Form here you can:

    Take a screenshot of the entire desktop.
    Take a screenshot of the current window only.
    Select a specific area to take a screenshot of.

You can also change settings, such as:

    Time-delay your screenshot.
    Include your pointer.
    Include the window border
    Apply effects.

Once you have taken a screenshot, you can name it and save it wherever you wish - including a USB if you wish to keep it off-system, perhaps with your USB Tails bootloader.

You can also use the Print Screen button on your keyboard to take a screenshot:

    PrtScr (Prt Sc on some devices) will take a screenshot of your entire UX screen.
    Alt + PrtScr will take a screenshot of your current active window.
    Your screenshot will be saved to Home by default.
