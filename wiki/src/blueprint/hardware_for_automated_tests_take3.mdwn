# Rationale

In 2016 we gave our main server some more RAM, as a temporary solution
to cope with our workload, and as a way to learn about how to scale
it. See [[blueprint/hardware_for_automated_tests_take2]] for our
reasoning, lots of benchmark results, and conclusions.

It's working relatively well so far, but we may need to upgrade again
soonish, and improvements are always welcome in the contributor UX
area:

 * [[Building the ISO reproducibly|blueprint/reproducible_builds]]
   with Vagrant will be slower, due to nested virtualization, and will
   require more storage. This will make the feedback loop longer for
   developers if do nothing about it.
 * As we add more automated tests, and re-enable tests previously
   flagged as fragile, a full test run takes longer and longer.
   We're now up to 160 minutes / run. We can't make it faster by
   adding RAM anymore, nor by adding CPUs to ISO testers, but faster
   CPU cores would fix that.
 * Building our website takes a long while, which makes ISO builds
   slower. This will get worse as new languages are added to our
   website. Faster CPU cores would fix that.
 * We had to turn off one of our ISO testers to make room for other
   services. This increases the waiting time in queue for an ISO test
   job (XXX: compute actual numbers).
 * Average waiting time in queue for an ISO build job is still too
   high (XXX: compute actual numbers).
 * Our current server was purchased at the end of 2014. The hardware
   can last quite a few more years, but we should plan (at least
   budget-wise) for replacing it when it is 5 years old, at the end of
   2019, to the latest.

# Options

## Replace lizard

Pros:

 * No initial development nor skills to learn: we can run our test
   suite in exactly the same way as we currently do.
 * On-going cost increases only slightly (we probably won't get
   low-voltage CPUs this time).
 * We can sell the current hardware while it's still current, and get
   some of our bucks back.

Cons:

 * High initial investment.
 * Hard to specify what hardware we need.

## Dedicated ISO testing machine, no nested virtualization

Pros:

 * Fast.

Cons:

 * Medium to high initial investment.
 * On-going cost for hosting 2 servers.
 * Hard to specify what hardware we need.
 * We currently _reboot_ isotesters between test suite runs ⇒ if we go
   this way we need to learn how to clean up after various kinds of
   test suite failure.
 * Our test suite currently assumes only one instance is running on
   a given system ⇒ if we go this way we have to remove this limitation.

## Dedicated ISO testing machine, with nested virtualization

Pros:

 * No initial development nor skills to learn: we can run our test
   suite in exactly the same way as we currently do.

Cons:

 * Medium to high initial investment.
 * On-going cost for hosting 2 servers.
 * Hard to specify what hardware we need.

## Run builds and/or tests in the cloud

E.g. we could run KVM guests within AWS HVM instances (see
[Amazon EC2 Instance Types](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/)
for details).

If we build ISO images in the cloud, then we need to:

 * either download lots of data from the cloud;
 * or also run our tests and our nightly builds web server there too.

If we only run automated tests in the cloud, then we need to upload
lots of ISO images to it.

Pros:

 * Scalable as much as we can (afford), both to react to varying
   workloads on the short term (some days we build and test tons of
   ISO images, some days a lot fewer), and to adjust to changing needs
   on the long term.
 * No initial investment cost.
 * No hardware failures we have to deal with.
 * We can try various kinds of instances until we find the right one,
   compared to hardware that requires careful planning and
   somewhat-informed guesses (mistakes in this area can only be fixed
   years later: for example, choosing low-voltage CPUs, that are
   suboptimal for our workload).
 * We can choose whether we want persistent VMs or VMs created on the
   fly (in terms of storage, and in terms of online/offline status).
 * Frees lots of resources on our current bare metal server, that can
   be reused for other purposes.
 * Our next bare metal server can be much cheaper, wrt. both initial
   investment and on-going costs (it will suck less power).

Cons:

 * We need to learn how to manage systems in the cloud, how to deal
   with billing, and how to control these systems from Jenkins.
 * On-going cost: XXX (unknown so far, would need to be researched)
 * We need to trust a third-party somewhat.
