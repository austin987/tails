Design work done in 2015
========================

[[!toggle id="archive" text="Archive of the design work done in 2015"]]

[[!toggleable id="archive" text="""

### First iteration

For the first iteration we did some parallel designs:

  - [[wireframe by sajolida|1st_iteration/wireframe-sajolida-20150323.odg]]
  - [wireframe by tchou](https://labs.riseup.net/code/attachments/download/722/wireframe-tchou-20150323.pdf)

### Router, second iteration

We refined the first iteration still with parallel designs:

  - [[presentation by sajolida|router/2nd_iteration/router-sajolida-20150325.odp]]
  - [[presentation by tchou|router/2nd_iteration/router-tchou-20150325.odp]]
  - [[rainbow table of testing both proposal with the same people|router/2nd_iteration/router-testing-20150325.ods]]

### Router, third iteration

  - [[interactive LibreOffice prototype|router/3rd_iteration/router-3rd-iteration.fodp]]
  - [[wireframe|router/3rd_iteration/router-3rd-iteration.fodg]]
  - [[verbatim of user testing notes by sajolida|router_3rd_iteration_testing.txt]]

Design work done in 2017
========================

- [Discussion leading to the split of the download as a dedicated page](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-ux/2017-June/003394.html)
- [Video of the paper prototype showing the happy path of the new download page](https://un.poivron.org/~sajolida/download-and-verify.mp4)
- [Archive of the WireframeSketcher screens](https://un.poivron.org/~sajolida/download-and-verify.zip)
- This also made the download page better for power users who were asking for a direct download link.

Open problems
=============

  - Suggest human strategies to avoid targeted malware:
    - Clone from a friend
    - Use a different computer than yours
    - Use Linux if available around you
  - Investigate how we could monitor the usage of the assistant: most
    common path, failures, people leaving, etc. But this can have
    privacy issues.
  - Integrate system requirements.
  - Integrate information about organizations offering training.

Future work
===========

Faster checksum computation in *Tails Verification*
---------------------------------------------------

- *DAVE* used to rely on a native call (`nsICryptoHash`) which is not
  available anymore to WebExtensions. It was so fast that we never felt
  the need to measure how many seconds it took; probably less than 5.

- *Tails Verification* relies on the *Forge* library and takes 45
  seconds on a Core i5 M520.

Asking upstream a new API for checksum calculation sounds hard as it
would require lobbying both Mozilla and Chrome. An alternative could be
to rewrite the checksum calculation in
[WebAssembly](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly).

Mac compatibility list
----------------------

Mac users still face the most complicated situation, with no graphical
technique for USB and unpredictable hardware. If no
[[!tails_ticket 11682 desc="graphical installation method for macOS"]]
can be found, this could be improved by
[[maintaining a list of Mac models and their compatibility with Tails
and our different installation techniques|assistant/mac]].

Better booting instructions
---------------------------

Booting is still a major pain point for people trying to start Tails for
the first time. Future work might involve:

  - Screencast to explain how to use the boot menu key. ([[!tails_ticket 10649]])
  - Better list of boot menu keys, like the [[Mac compatibility
    list|assistant/mac]].
  - Investigating whether it would be possible to tell the host
    operating system to restart on Tails directly.
    See for example: <http://www.askvg.com/tip-5-easy-ways-to-switch-from-windows-8-to-other-installed-os-in-dual-boot-environment/>

Integrate warnings
------------------

Our [[warning page|doc/about/warning]] is good but it's also one of the
oldest page in our documentation and it would deserve a bit of work
([[!tails_ticket 8845]]). Furthermore, it would make a lot of sense to
integrate it in the assistant, to teach people about Tails as they are
installing it.

An idea would be to display our warnings while the ISO
image is [[downloaded|install/download]] ([[!tails_ticket 9386]]).
The download page from 2017 makes this more complicated since the verification
extension cannot monitor the beginning and end of the download but most likely
not impossible.
