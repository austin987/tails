Ticket [[!tails_ticket 8578]],

This page summarizes resources we provide to help you make Tails research more effective.

Based on Debian GNU/Linux, working on Tails is mostly glue work, based on research and existing software.

We'd like to work with the academic research community in order to solve some open research questions that exist for live distributions like Tails. This page consists of various open ended research problems we'd like to see resolved.

When you are working on a research question that is interesting for us as a project or solving a related problem to Tails **please** talk to us. The *earlier* the **better** so we can help you make the *right* assumptions.

When you worked on a problem and published a paper about it, please let us know and we'll list your paper on a page on our website and link it from here.

The best way to reach us is through the [tails-dev](https://mailman.boum.org/listinfo/tails-dev/) mailinglist, or at our (possibly) encrypted address tails[AT]boum.org

## Academic communities
The questions posed by Tails might me of interest for researchers from various fields. A list of potentially interested communities that we are aware of can be seen below.
