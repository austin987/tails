The persistence feature for additional software packages is a great tool
to make Tails more flexible for diverse scenarios without having to
bloat the ISO image.

The current limitations include:

  - No user interface. Currently you have to edit a file as root. ([[!tails_ticket 5996 desc="#5996"]])

  - Their Installation locks the opening of the desktop. ([[!tails_ticket 9059 desc="#9059"]])

  - They are checked for updates every time Tor is restarted. ([[!tails_ticket 9819 desc="#9819"]])

We are going to implement this feature for Tails 3.7 ([[!tails_ticket 9059 desc="#14593"]])

Proposed user experience
========================

0. Have a way to enable the feature (and its dependencies) in
*tails-persistence-setup*. This besically means cheking both
*APT Lists* and *APT Packages Cache* (much welcome)

1. When installing a new package, either through the command line or
through Synaptic, the user is asked whether she wants to make it
persistent.

**XXX**: long-term wise, we should probably focus on _GNOME
Software_ instead of _Synaptic_; if something works for both, fine,
but the PackageKit D-Bus interface might be easier to support than
hooking APT/dpkg, so one option would be to only support installation
& removal done via PackageKit (i.e. either with _GNOME Software_ or
using `pkcon` on the command line) and not operations done directly
with `apt` or _Synaptic_.

2. When removing a persistent package, the user is asked whether she
wants to remove it from the list of persistent packages.

3. Have a list of the persistent packages visible in the persistence
wizard. As the user need to be able to check the state of this feature
outside of APT operations.

4. Allow removing packages from the list in 3 (welcome).

5. Allow adding packages to the list in 3 (we don't really want that, do we?).

Implementation
--------------

  - 1 and 2 might be possible to implement using APT hooks or PackageKit 
    DBus interface. We need to
    investigate how these hooks would communicate with the desktop

  - 3 might require modifying the general concept of the persistence
    wizard which is currently only a list of features that are activated
    or not, without feedback on the information managed by each of them.

  - 4 should be easy to implement once we have 3 as removing packages
    from the list doesn't need any validity check. Note that we would
    always answer Yes to debconf questions.

  - 5 would require validating the packages added to the list to make
    sure that they can be installed. Installing packages on the fly as
    they are added to the list might help solving this.

  - We could merge both the **APT Packages** and **APT Lists**
    persistence features
