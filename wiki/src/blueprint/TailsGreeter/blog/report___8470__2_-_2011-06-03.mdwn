## Current progress

- project language switch vala -> python
- main reason: working example made in python dy doctormo
- big repo update: with 'upstream' branch for doctormo's code and 'master' branch for actual development

## Problems

- scm conversion with 'taylor' failed so dumb import of entire bzr tree is performed
- university workload spike started earlier than anticipated

## Near-future plans

- mange university workload
- make .deb for doctormo's code
- integrate .deb building with git

## Note:

Next week will be mostly dedicated to exam, presentation and other university activities - hence tiny plans for it.
