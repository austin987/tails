## Current progress

- git repositories ready (or, frankly, I feel ready to use them :)
- tried debian packaging and it seems to work ("seems" because it's readily available packages, not my own code yet)
- found example dbus implementation of greeter interface in python:
<http://doctormo.org/2011/04/12/how-to-make-a-gnome-login-screen-in-python/>
- walked through vala code samples for dbus & GUI

## Problems

- university workload increased, will post corresponding changes to schedule soon
- GDM's interfaces are not so well documented

## Near-future plans

- official coding start
- pick build system (scons? cmake? autotools?), in a mean time will use plain old makefile
- iron-out workflow (code, test, commit, build, report sequence)
