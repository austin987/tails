This is the place to work on the custom error messages that we want to
have in Tor Browser instead of **Unable to connect** and **The proxy
server is refusing connections**. The rationale for this can be found in
[[!tails_ticket 9473]].

For the record, these are the default error messages:

The proxy server is refusing connections
========================================

Firefox is configured to use a proxy server that is refusing
connections.

  - Check the proxy settings to make sure that they are correct.
  - Contact your network administrator to make sure the proxy server is
    working.
  - Check your internet connection

Unable to connect
=================

Firefox can't establish a connection to the server at www.google.com.

  - The site could be temporarily unavailable or too busy. Try again in
    a few moments.
  - If you are unable to load any pages, check your computer's network
    connection.
  - If your computer or network is protected by a firewall or proxy,
    make sure that Tor Browser is permitted to access the Web.
