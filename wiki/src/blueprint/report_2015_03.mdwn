[[!meta title="Tails report for March, 2015"]]

March was full of surprises: first Mozilla changed the release date for Firefox, so the Tor team had to change the release date for Tor Browser Bundle, and we had to change the release date of version 1.3.1. Usually, those things get late... but this time, it has been advanced one week earlier!

But then... a whole bunch of vulnerabilities were discovered in Firefox, so they did an emergency release, and we had to release 1.3.1 early as well. And the planned 1.3.1 became 1.3.2. So, instead of a release-free month, we had a two-releases months!

Despite the hectic changes of plans, we did some good work. And for starters, a bit a recursivity: in March, we... published the [[two|news/report_end_of_2014]] [[previous|news/report_2015_01-02]] reports ;)
