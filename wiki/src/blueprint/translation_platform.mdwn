[[!meta title="Translation platform"]]

Our (website) translation infrastructure has a pretty high barrier for
new translators, especially those who are not familiar with Git and/or
the command line.
Furthermore, the current process makes it hard to add new languages, as often a team cannot be built easily over a long period of time and a web interface could nevertheless help keep translations until a new person arrives.

Corresponding ticket: [[!tails_ticket 9049]]

MUST
====

* provide a usable easy web interface
* be usable from Tor Browser
* automatic pull from main Git repo
* provide a common glossary for each language, easy to use and improve
* allow translators to view, in the correct order, all strings that
  come from the entire page being translated, both in English and in
  the target language
* provide user roles (admin, reviewer, translator)

SHOULD
======

* be "privacy sensitive", i.e. be operated by a non-profit
* allow translators to push translations through Git (so that core
  developers only have to fetch reviewed translations from there)
* provide support for Git standard development branches (devel, stable,
  and testing) but we could also agree upon translation only master
  through this interface
* provide some kind of bug reporting feature for missing strings, missing pages, wrong or outdated translations
* provide checks for inconsistent translations
* provide feature to write/read comments between translators

MAY
===

* allow translating topic branches without confusing translators,
  causing duplicate/premature work, fragmentation or merge conflicts
  -- e.g. present only new or updated strings in topic branches;
  see <https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-l10n/2015-March/002102.html>
  for details
* provide a feature to easily see what is new, what needs updating, what are translation priorities
* provide possibility to set up new languages easily
* send email notifications
  - to reviewers whenever new strings have been translated or updated
  - to translators whenever a resource is updated
* respect authorship (different committers?)
* provide statistics about the percentage of translated and fuzzy strings
