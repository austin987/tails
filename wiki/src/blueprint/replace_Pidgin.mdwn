Corresponding ticket: [[!tails_ticket 8573]]

It would be nice to replace Pidgin with another secure IM client. Unfortunately no good alternative seems to exist today. To be able to decide, if another IM client would be a suitable replacement this document should list the requirements a client needs to fulfill to fit the bill.

The document can also list candidate clients together with some indication where they are lacking (and where they shine).

# Requirements

## General requirements

### OTR support

## XMPP (Jabber)

## IRC

# Candidate alternatives 

## Tor Messenger

## xmpp-client
