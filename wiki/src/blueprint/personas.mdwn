# Collective process from August 2017

Summary of a 2 hours session we did with 12 core contributors.

This process is inspired by the workshop described in _The Essential
Persona Lifecycle_ by Tamara Adlin and John Pruitt, Chapter 4 *Persona
conception and gestation*.

- General explanation of what personas are and why they are useful (15')

- Everybody prepares, in silent, sticky notes describing a user and their goal. (15')

  For example:

  - "*Women that go through domestic violence and wants to escape from that.*"
  - "*Webmasters of a sensitive website that wants to hack on it.*"

- All together we assimilate these sticky notes and the ones identified
  in August 2016 by *types of users*. (30')

  We start with predefined categories based on last year's output and
  adding new ones or splitting existing ones as needed. There should be
  no more than 10 stick notes per category.

  - Predefined categories:
    - Activist
    - Censorship evader
    - Contributor
    - Darknet customer
    - Information freedom fighter
    - Nomadic
    - Privacy geek
    - Surveilled at home

  - Final categories:
    - Activist
    - Censorship evader
    - Contributor
    - Darknet customer
    - Evil people
    - Information freedom fighter
    - Journalist or researcher
    - Law enforcement
    - Nomadic
    - People helping others in shit
    - People we don't want to help
    - Privacy geek
    - Sensitive content creator
    - Surveilled at home
    - Surveilled at work

- The facilitator takes pictures of the resulting assimilation and
  removes the user categories.

- All together we assimilate again the same stick notes and group them
  by *user goals* (45').

  User goals are short sentences starting with "*I want...*" or "*I need...*".
  There should be no more than 10 stick notes per category. Sticky notes
  that fit in more than one goal can be duplicated.

- All together we summarize these goals by identifying main goals and
  subgoals. (10')

  - Final goals:

    A.  I want to hide personally identifying information or sensitive information about myself
      - I want to keep content & information secret from my government
      - I want to keep information secret from my family and close people
      - I want to access sensitive information stealthily
      - I want to hide my identity
      - I want to hide my location and identity
      - I want to hide my location
      - I don't want to raise suspicion

    B.  I want to communicate and collaborate securely
      - I want to communicate securely with known peers
      - I want to communicate securely with unknown peers
      - I want to communicate with others who are under surveillance
      - We want to share and work on documents privately

    C.  I want to store information safely
      - I need to safely store my data
      - I want to edit or anonymize my data

    D.  I want to leave no trace on the computer
      - I need to use a computer that is not mine

    E.  I want information to be free
      - I want to access censored information online
      - I want to publish sensitive information

    F. I want to avoid corporate & governmental information gathering on my data
      - I want to understand people using Tails
      - I just want more privacy

# Skeletons

After this collective session, the core team working on the personas (3
people) started preparing skeletons, rough descriptions of each persona,
based on the main goals identified earlier. Each persona is primarily
focused on a single main goal but also corresponds to some subgoals of
other categories.

On top of demographics, background, and technical skills information,
our framework includes holistic security and threat modeling information
(based on the [Personas Framework for Internet
Freedom](http://internetfreedom.secondmuse.com/framework-elements/developing-personas/)
developed by SecondMuse):

  1. Name (genderneutral)
  2. Occupation
  3. Background
  4. Motivations
  5. Challenges and threats
  6. Communications
  7. Goals
  8. Use cases
  9. Definition of security
  10. Key Technologies used regularly
    a. Features used in Tails
    b. Features used outside of Tails
  11. Threat perception
  12. Security precautions

    country, so that the government cannot censor this information.

  - During the protest they leave their phones at home. They are doing
    most of their communication beforehand. Although they take photos
    and videos of the protests and try to publish this information on
    websites which are censored within the country. They got to get it
    online as soon as it's produced on social media and they also want
