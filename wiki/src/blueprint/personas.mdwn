[[!toggle id="2017-08" text="Collective process from August 2017"]]

[[!toggleable id="2017-08" text="""

Summary of a 2 hours session we did with 12 core contributors.

This process is inspired by the workshop described in _The Essential
Persona Lifecycle_ by Tamara Adlin and John Pruitt, Chapter 4 *Persona
conception and gestation*.

- General explanation of what personas are and why they are useful (15')

- Everybody prepares, in silent, sticky notes describing a user and their goal. (15')

  For example:

  - "*Women that go through domestic violence and wants to escape from that.*"
  - "*Webmasters of a sensitive website that wants to hack on it.*"

- All together we assimilate these sticky notes and the ones identified
  in August 2016 by *types of users*. (30')

  We start with predefined categories based on last year's output and
  adding new ones or splitting existing ones as needed. There should be
  no more than 10 stick notes per category.

  - Predefined categories:
    - Activist
    - Censorship evader
    - Contributor
    - Darknet customer
    - Information freedom fighter
    - Nomadic
    - Privacy geek
    - Surveilled at home

  - Final categories:
    - Activist
    - Censorship evader
    - Contributor
    - Darknet customer
    - Evil people
    - Information freedom fighter
    - Journalist or researcher
    - Law enforcement
    - Nomadic
    - People helping others in shit
    - People we don't want to help
    - Privacy geek
    - Sensitive content creator
    - Surveilled at home
    - Surveilled at work

- The facilitator takes pictures of the resulting assimilation and
  removes the user categories.

- All together we assimilate again the same stick notes and group them
  by *user goals* (45').

  User goals are short sentences starting with "*I want...*" or "*I need...*".
  There should be no more than 10 stick notes per category. Sticky notes
  that fit in more than one goal can be duplicated.

- All together we summarize these goals by identifying main goals and
  subgoals. (10')

  See "User goals for using Tails" below.

### Background

- Is a social science student in Hanoi.

- Is part of a group organizing a public massive protest against new
  government policies and laws.

- Is considered to be quite tech-savvy by others in their group though
  they never really studied computer science.

- Wants to be stealthy and anonymous, but the protest needs to be public
  and advertised.

- Their group needs to send out strategic information to the public so
  that citizens actually know where to show up.

- In order to publish this information, their group uses websites which
  are not hosted on servers within the country, so that the government
  cannot shut them down but these websites are censored within the
  country.

- Their group uses social media: Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, etc.

- Their group doesn't trust the local press but sometimes interacts
  pseudonymously with the international press or the Vietnamese diaspora
  (on social media, over email, etc.).

- Their group is doing most of their communication beforehand.

- During the protest, leaves their phones at home and use devices that
  are not theirs (burner phones, cameras, etc.), so that they can hide
  their involvement in the organization of this protest.

- After the protest, their group tries to publish text and images about
  the protest as soon as possible.

### Motivations

- Wants to lead social change in their country without being put
  themselves under the spotlight.

- Wants information to be free in their country: they want to speak
  freely and they want others to have access to uncensored information.

### Challenges and threats

- Use networks.

- Access information online.

- Use applications that the government is not monitoring.

- Use mesh applications.

- Help others access censored information; for example by teaching
  people anti-censorship technologies.

### Communications

### Primary goal

#### E. I want information to be free

- I want to access censored information online
- I want to publish sensitive information

### Secondary goals
