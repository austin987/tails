[[!meta title="Bootstrapping workflow"]]

This blueprint analyses and proposes simplifications to the workflow of
a new user discovering Tails until she gets a full-featured Tails USB
stick with persistence.

Big logical steps are:

  - Learn what Tails is
  - Download the ISO
  - Verify the ISO
  - Install medium (might require going through a intermediary Tails)
  - Create persistence

In 2015 we worked on several improvements to simplify greatly this
workflow:

  - Tails Installer in [Debian](https://tracker.debian.org/tails-installer) and [Ubuntu](https://launchpad.net/~tails-team/+archive/ubuntu/tails-installer)
  - [[Download and Verify Extension|contribute/design/dave]] for Firefox
  - [[Installation Assistant|assistant]] to guide the user throughout this process

Graphical installer for Mac
---------------------------

In 2015 we couldn't find a graphical way of creating an intermediary Tails on
USB stick from Mac ([[!tails_ticket 8802]]) and people have to go through the
command line. Finding this would be game changer for Mac users.

Lead people from one big step to the next through software
----------------------------------------------------------

We could:

  - Add splash screen about *Tails Installer* when starting on an intermediary Tails USB stick. ([[!tails_ticket 8838]])
  - Add splash screen about persistence when starting for the first time on a final Tails USB stick.
