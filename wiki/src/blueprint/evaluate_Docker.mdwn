Availability on target platforms
================================

(as of 20141130)

Primary target platforms:

* Debian Wheezy: no, even in backports; installation is [possible
  using ugly methods](https://docs.docker.com/installation/debian/)
* Debian Jessie: 1.3.1~dfsg1-2, and an unblock request has been filed
  to let 1.3.2 in
* Debian sid: 1.3.2~dfsg1-1
* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS: 0.9.1, with 1.0.1 available in trusty-updates
* Ubuntu 14.10: 1.2.0

Bonus:

* Arch: 1.3.2
* Fedora: 1.3.0 flagged as stable, 1.3.2 in testing

API stability and backwards-compatibility
=========================================

- "all [Docker] containers are backwards compatible, pretty much to
  the first version. [...] In general backwards compatibility is a
  big deal in the Docker project"
  ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7985142), shykes
  is a Docker developer)
- Apparently the Docker 1.0 release broke older stuff, see e.g. the
  0.6 release in
  [the jenkins plugin changelog](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Docker+Plugin).

Random notes
============

* Since Docker 0.9, the default execution environment is libcontainer,
  instead of LXC. It now supports e.g. systemd-nspawn, libvirt-lxc,
  libvirt-sandbox, qemu/kvm, in addition to LXC.
* Docker seems to support sharing a directory between the host and
  a container, so on this front, we would not lose anything compared
  to Vagrant.
* Docker supports Linux and OSX.
* According to
  <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17989306/what-does-docker-add-to-just-plain-lxc>,
  Docker comes with tools to automatically build a container from
  source, version it, and upgrade it incrementally.
* Michael Prokop [gives
  pointers](http://michael-prokop.at/blog/2014/07/23/book-review-the-docker-book/)
  about Docker integration with Jenkins.
* As far as our build system is concerned, we don't care much to
  protect the host system from the build container. The main goal is
  to produce a reliable build environment.
* For security info about Linux containers in general, see the
  [[dedicated blueprint|blueprint/Linux_containers]].
* [overclockix](https://github.com/mbentley/overclockix) uses
  live-build and provides a Dockerfile for easier building.
* overlayfs support was added in Docker 1.4.0; we'll need that when
  using Debian Stretch/sid once Linux 3.18 lands in there after
  Jessie is released.

Test run
========

(20150120, Debian sid host, `feature/7530-docker` Git branch)

	sudo apt --no-install-recommends install docker.io aufs-tools
	sudo adduser "$(whoami)" docker
	su - "$(whoami)"
	make

* `TAILS_BUILD_OPTIONS="noproxy"` => run [apt-cacher-ng in a different
  container](https://docs.docker.com/examples/apt-cacher-ng/)
* Even with `--cache false`, some directories (`chroot`, `cache`) are
  saved and retrieved from the container upon shutdown; same for
  live-config -generated `config/*` files. That's because the current
  directory is shared read-write with the container somehow.
  This bind-mount should be read-only, but we still need to get the
  build artifacts back on the host.
