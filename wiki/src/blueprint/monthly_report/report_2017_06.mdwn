Releases
========

* [[Tails VERSION was released on MONTH DAY|news/version_VERSION]] ([major|minor] release).

* Tails VERSION+1 is [[scheduled for MONTH DAY|contribute/calendar]].

The following changes were introduced in Tails VERSION:

XXX: Copy the "Changes" section of the release notes, and compact a bit:

* Remove lines about software upgrade (that's not Tails itself).
* Remove screenshots.
* Remove "New features" and "Upgrades and changes" headlines.
* Remove line about Changelog.

Code
====

XXX: List important code work that is not covered already by the Release
     section (for example, the changes being worked on for the next version).

We've made great progress on simplifying the Tails Installer user interface. [[!tails_ticket 8859]]

## Reproducible Builds

We are still working on making Tails ISO images build reproducibly.
We've seen some images build in such a deterministic manner in March and 
even during a testing session. However, in some build environments it
does not work reliably yet and some new issues have manifested
themselves which need to be fixed until we can claim that our ISO 
images are really reproducible:

* [[!tails_ticlet 12641]] Comment changes in POT files make ISO non 
  reproducible

Furthermore, we are still working on documenting the new release process and 
verification options for our users.
([[!tails_ticket 12616]], [[!tails_ticket 12629]], [[!tails_ticket
12629]], [[!tails_ticket 12630]])

Other remaining issues on our test infrastructure include:

* [[!tails_ticket 12618]] Retrieving ISO build artifacts sometimes fails
  on Jenkins
* [[!tails_ticket 12574]] isobuilders system_disks check keeps switching
  between OK and WARNING since the switch to Vagrant

XXX: Report only if more scenarios have been written and add the diff from the previous month, for example:

       - Our test suite covers SCENARIOS scenarios, DIFF more that in May.


We've switched our mirror pool to mirrors serving files over HTTPS only.  [[!tails_ticket 12837]] Some mirrors in the round-robin fallback pool are still serving files over HTTP, and we are currently thinking about how to switch those to HTTPS too [[!tails_ticket 12833]]
