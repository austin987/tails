Welcome to Tails monthly report for November 2018! A lot has happened in the
last month, but first of all, we want to point you to our [[ongoing donation
campaign|donate]]! If everyone using Tails today donated $6, our fundraiser
would be done in just one day!

Upcoming releases
=================

Very soon, we will drastically simplify the installation for Windows
and macOS and improve support for UEFI computers! To this aim, with
the Tails 3.12 release [[scheduled for January
29|contribute/calendar]], we will start distributing *USB images* in
addition to *ISO images*.


Code
====

* We've been working hard since a few months on our USB image project
  ([[!tails_ticket 15292]]) and will soon send a call for testing.
  The main remaining challenge is to build the USB image reproducibly
  ([[!tails_ticket 15985]]).

* We resumed work on porting Tails to Debian 10 (Buster).
  Our Foundations Team will have a sprint focused on this topic next
  month and should publish a first beta release by the end of April.

* We identified and fixed one root cause for a major problem some
  users face when upgrading Tails: part of the user interface that
  provided feedback about the progress of the upgrade was broken,
  which lead users to restart Tails before the upgrade was fully
  applied. While we were at it, we improved the user experience of the
  upgrade process, which will now require user confirmation before
  shutting down the network connection. ([[!tails_ticket 14754]],
  [[!tails_ticket 15282]])

* Tails 3.11, [[scheduled for December 11|contribute/calendar]] and [[released 
  on time|/news/version_3.11]] fixed a great number of long-standing problems 
  and recent regressions.

Hot topics on our help desk

Infrastructure
==============

We made good progress on adjusting our infrastructure to upcoming
changes at our previous providers:

* We now host our website on our own infrastructure. An unintended but
  welcome side-effect is that browsing our website is snappier than it
  used to. ([[!tails_ticket 14588]])
* We renamed our Redmine instance from <https://labs.riseup.net/> to
  <https://redmine.tails.boum.org/>. This avoids confusion about who
  is responsible for this service and it will allow our Riseup friends
  to set up *single sign-on* (SSO) for their own services.

Funding
=======

We continued working on our yearly donation campaign:

* We added to our donation banner a counter for the total amount. We
  reached 23% of our fundraising goal in the first half of the campaign.

* We got 64% more donors but raised 51% less in amount compared to
  last year. More people are donating but we are missing the big donors
  that we had in the past.

Outreach
========

We published an [[extensive summary of our achievements in
2018|news/achievements_in_2018]] and also announced that in addition to
bitcoins, you can now donate using [[four new
cryptocurrencies|news/new_cryptocurrencies]]. By the way, donations! Have you
already met our [[donation campaign site|donate]]? Cryptocurrencies are only
one way to donate, but wouldn't it be interesting to try to donate in every way
possible?

Upcoming events
---------------

* At the monthly meeting, the idea of attending
  [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2019/) came up

* [sajolida pointed
  out](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-project/2018-November/001206.html)
the [Internet Freedom Festival](https://internetfreedomfestival.org/), which
will happen in April next year.
