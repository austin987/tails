Code
====

XXX: List important code work that is not covered already by the Release
     section (for example, the changes being worked on for the next version).

* intrigeri
  [started a discussion](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2017/08/msg00090.html)
  about enabling AppArmor by default in Debian. So far the feedback
  has been good.
* We [[decided to evaluate|blueprint/Debian_testing]] this year
  whether we can base Tails on quarterly snapshots of Debian testing.
  If we end up answering this question favorably, then the first such
  release would happen early in 2018 (January or April).
* We worked on regressions introduced in Tails 3.0 that our Help Desk
  and Foundations Team deems high-priority, such as
  [[!tails_ticket 12733]] and [[!tails_ticket 13437]].
* We [[!tails_ticket 12707 desc="worked on Tails Installer"]] to make
  it create larger system partitions so that users can benefit more
  often from automatic upgrades, instead of having to perform
  a manual upgrade.
* We are in the process of [[!tails_ticket 8281 desc="evaluating"]]
  whether GNOME's on-screen keyboard could fully replace _Florence_.
* We started [[!tails_ticket 12732 desc="porting"]] Tails to Linux 4.12.
* We started organizing teams, work, timeline and workflow for our
  upcoming OTF contract:
  - [[!tails_ticket 14468 desc="VeraCrypt support in GNOME: make it easier to integrate Tails into workflows with other users and operating systems"]]
  - Additional software: make it easier to tailor Tails to specific
    needs for sensitive data manipulation ([[!tails_ticket 14568]],
    [[!tails_ticket 5551]] and friends)

Documentation and website
=========================

- We renamed our "*Easy*" tasks for new contributors as "[[*Starter*
  tasks|contribute/working_together/criteria_for_starter_tasks]]".

User experience
===============

- We helped Tor [redesign and rephrase Tor
  Launcher](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19IApm-dzSE7JiN_lATML4FVwqGL1I_Kfy_HqpwC75z8/edit?usp=sharing),
  the configuration screens of Tor Browser that are also used in Tails.

- We held a collective workshop to identify personas with 12 core
  contributors. We started with a brainstorming of Tails users and their
  goals, followed by a collective grouping of all the identified use
  cases into categories based on *type of users* and *user goals*.

  After that, a smaller team started drafting persona skeletons based on
  this output, including holistic security and threat modeling aspects
  for each persona.

  The process and output are documented in our [[blueprint on
  personas|blueprint/personas#2017-08]].
