Pre-built images
================

Pre-built images can be downloaded using BitTorrent or HTTP.

Every ISO image we ship is a hybrid one:

* it can be burnt to a CD;
* it also contains a full disk image (including partition table) and
  can thus be copied (using `dd`) to a USB stick; the USB stick's
  content is lost in the operation.

HTTP
----

HTTP mirrors can be reached on <http://dl.amnesia.boum.org/tails/>.

BitTorrent
----------

Here are the latest available BitTorrent files, signatures and
packages lists ([full list](/torrents/files/)):

[[!map pages="torrents/files/*.torrent
or torrents/files/*.asc
or torrents/files/*.packages
or torrents/files/*.sha256
"
show="30"]]

We also have
a [mailing-list](https://boum.org/mailman/listinfo/amnesia-news), as
well as [RSS](/torrents/rss/index.rss) and
[Atom](/torrents/rss/index.atom) feeds to announce new available
BitTorrent files.

Verify the image integrity after downloading
--------------------------------------------

The released images are signed with our [[GnuPG key]]; you
can, and should, verify their integrity before using them. Example:

        gpg --verify amnesia-gnome-fr-0.2-20090815.iso.asc amnesia-gnome-fr-0.2-20090815.iso

(FIXME: explain a user-friendly way to do so)

Help spreading T(A)ILS
----------------------

Any help is more than welcome: don't hesitate seeding our Torrents.
If you want to setup a web mirror, please [[drop us an email|/contact]].

Source code
===========

You can fetch the source code as a [[tarball]] or using [[git]], and
[[build]] your own Live system image.
