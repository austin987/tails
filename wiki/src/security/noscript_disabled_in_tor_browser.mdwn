<div class="caution">Tor Browser in Tails 3.13.1 is not safe to use
without taking the manual steps listed below each time you start
Tails!</div>

Starting from Friday May 3, a problem in *Firefox* and *Tor Browser*
disabled all add-ons, especially *NoScript* which is used to:

- Strengthen *Tor Browser* against some JavaScript attacks that can lead
  to compromised accounts and credentials on websites.

- Enable or disable JavaScript on some websites using the *NoScript*
  interface, if you use it.

If *NoScript* is activated, the *NoScript* icon appears in the top-right corner
and *Tor Browser* is safe:

If *NoScript* is deactivated, the *NoScript* icon is absent from the top-right corner and *Tor Browser* is unsafe:

## Activate *NoScript* manually

To secure *Tor Browser* in Tails 3.13.1 or earlier, you must activate
*NoScript* every time you start Tails:

1. Open the address <span class="command">about:config</span> in *Tor
   Browser*.

1. Click the **I accept the risk!** button.

1. At the top of the page, search for
   <span class="command">xpinstall.signatures.required</span>.

1. Double-click on the **xpinstall.signatures.required** line in the
   results to set its value to **false**.

1. Verify that *NoScript* is activated again.
