  <h2>Your secure computer anywhere</h2>

  <p>Tails is installed on a USB stick that you can run on any computer
  instead of starting on Windows or macOS. You can temporarily <em>turn you own
  computer into a secure machine</em> or <em>stay
  safe while using someone else's computer</em>. You don't have to
  worry about the viruses on your Windows.</p>

  <p class="smaller">Tails takes
  [[!inline pages="inc/stable_amd64_iso_size" raw="yes" sort="age"]]
  to download, ½ hour to install, and any USB stick of 8 GB minimum.</p>

  <!-- PIC: Tails is like a tent. You can carry it with you and use it
  anywhere! -->

<!--
P3: What would be the "insecure" of macOS?  I feel like Mac protects privacy Why should I bother? Is this really better?
P3: Maybe I don't have install rights on Windows
P4: Also... some USB sticks have viruses on them. Will Tails tell me if the USB stick is okay before I install?

P3: [DONE] The installation of an OS takes several hours / minutes
P5: [DONE] "Instead of Win/mac" [had to be read twice, sentence structure] reads to them like Tails **only** works with Linux

  <h2>Amnesia</h2>

  <p>Tails always starts from the same clean state and <em>everything you
  did disappears</em> automatically when you shut down Tails.

  <p class="smaller">Usually, almost everything you do can leave traces on the
  computer:</p>

  <ul class="smaller">
    <li>Websites that you visited, even in private mode</li>
    <li>Files that you opened, even if you deleted them</li>
    <li>Passwords, even if you use a password manager</li>
    <li>All the devices and Wi-Fi networks that you used</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="smaller">On the contrary, Tails only runs from the memory of the computer,
  without ever writing anything to the hard disk. The memory is entirely
  deleted when you shutdown Tails, erasing all possible traces.</p>

<!--
P1: Amnesia vs Persistence: not so clear...
P2: Amnesia: didn't know the word, "like a sandbox"
P4: What does amnesia mean?

P3: [WONT: Explained later] Amnesia: pros & cons. I will forget what I did, eg. good website
P5: [WORK] This property is important, means there's no connection to the existing OS!

  <h2>Encrypted Persistence</h2>

  <p>You can <em>save some of your files and configuration</em>
  in an encrypted Persistence, protected by a password. If you want, you can optionally store in
  your Persistence: your documents, your browser bookmarks, your emails, and
  even some additional software.</p>

  <!-- PIC: You can carry your personal things in your secure backpack and
  set them up if your tent if you want to. -->

P4: Persistence and amnesia should be at the same place!

P2: [WORK] Persistence: assume it's on the USB stick

  <h2>Digital security toolbox</h2>

  <p>Tails includes many applications to <em>work on sensitive documents

  <ul class="smaller">
    <li><i>Tor Browser</i> with <i>uBlock</i>, an secure browser and an ad-blocker</li>
    <li><i>Thunderbird</i> with <i>Enigmail</i>, an email application with GnuPG</li>
    <li><i>KeePassXC</i>, a password manager</li>
    <li><i>LibreOffice</i>, an office suite</li>
    <li><i>OnionShare</i>, to share files over Tor</li>
    <li>and many more!</li>
  </ul>

  <p>All the applications included in Tails
  are ready-to-use and configured with safe defaults to <em>prevent
  mistakes</em>:</p>

  <ul class="smaller">
    <li>If an application tries to connect to the Internet without Tor, it is blocked automatically.</li>

  <h2>Tor for everything</h2>

  <p>Everything you do on the Internet from Tails goes through the Tor
  network. Tor encrypts and anonymizes your connection by
  passing it through <em>3 relays around the
  world</em> operated by many different people and organizations.</p>

  <p class="smaller">This way, a single relay never knows both where the encrypted
  connection is coming from and where it is going to. Tor is <em>secure
  by design</em> even if a few relays are malicious:</p>

  <ul class="smaller">
    <li>The 1st relay only knows where you are coming from but not where
    you are going to.</li>
    <li>This 3rd relay only knows where you are going to but not where
    you are coming from.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="smaller">Tor has more than 6&#8239;000 relays. Organizations running Tor relays
  include universities like the MIT, activist groups like Riseup,
  non-profit like Derechos Digitales, Internet hosting companies like
  Private Internet Access, etc. The huge diversity of people and
  organizations running Tor relays make it more secure and more
  sustainable.</p>

  <h2>Avoid online surveillance and censorship</h2>

  <p>Tor prevents someone watching your Internet connection from learning
  <em><i>what</i> you are doing on the Internet</em>. You can avoid
  censorship because it is <em>impossible for a censor to know</em> which
  sites you are visiting.</p>

  <p class="smaller">If connecting to Tor is blocked or dangerous to use from where you
  are, for example Iran or China, you can use <i>bridges</i> to connect to
  Tor in a more discrete way. Different types of bridges work better in
  different places.</p>

<!--
P2: [DONE] Censorship: Tor but also something else? because Tor works very bad in China...
-->

  </div>

</div>

<div class="row follow">

  <div class="col-md-7">

  <h2>Change identity and avoid tracking</h2>

  <p>Tor also prevents the websites that you are visiting from learning
  <em><i>where</i> and <i>who</i> you are</em>, unless you tell them. You
  can visit websites <em>anonymously or change your identity</em>. Online
  trackers won't be able to follow you around from one site to another
  anymore.</p>

  <p class="smaller">You can publish a blog or manage a social media
  account entirely from Tails. If you only access it from
  Tails, it cannot be related to you. You can store documents
  and images related to this different identity in your Persistence,
  keep your passwords in <i>KeePassXC</i>, have a dedicated
  email account in <i>Thunderbird</i>, etc.</p>

<!--
P5: What the difference between *avoid tracking* and *anti-censorship/surveillance*?

  <h2>Top security for free</h2>

  <p>Because nobody should have to pay to be safe while using a computer,
  we are giving out Tails for free and try to make it easy to use by

  by donations from people like you and organizations that support
  Internet freedom.</p>

  have supported Tails financially.</p>
