If you've found a bug in The (Amnesic) Incognito Live System, please
read the [[bug_reporting]] guidelines and post about it here. [[TODO]]
items go elsewhere.

- bugs that are fixed in Git, and will therefore be fixed in the
  next release, are tagged `pending` and appear on the [[list of
  pending bugs|bugs/pending]];
- bugs that have been fixed in a shipped release are
  tagged `bugs/done` and appear on the [[list of fixed
  bugs|bugs/done]].
