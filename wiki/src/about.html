  <h2>Your secure computer anywhere</h2>

  <p class="big">To use Tails, shut down the computer and start on your Tails USB stick
  instead of starting on Windows, macOS, or Linux.</p>

  <p class="big">You can temporarily <strong>turn your own
  computer into a secure machine</strong>. You can also <strong>stay
  safe while using the computer of somebody else</strong>.</p>

  <p class="medium">Tails is a
  [[!inline pages="inc/stable_amd64_iso_size" raw="yes" sort="age"]]
  download and takes ½ hour to install. Tails can be installed on any USB stick of 8 GB minimum.
  Tails works on most computers less than 10 years old.
  You can start again on the other operating system after you shut down
  Tails.</p>

  <p class="medium">You don't have to worry about the computer having viruses
  because Tails runs independently from the other operating system and never uses the hard disk.
  But, Tails cannot always protect you if you
  install it from a computer with viruses or if you use it on a computer
  with malicious hardware, like keyloggers.</p>

  <i class="metaphor">Like a tent, Tails is amnesic: it always starts empty and leaves no trace when you leave.</i>

  <div class="text order-1">

  <h2>Amnesia</h2>

  <p class="big">Tails always starts from the same clean state and <strong>everything you
  do disappears</strong> automatically when you shut down Tails.</p>

  <p class="medium">Without Tails, almost everything you do can leave traces on the
  computer:</p>

  <ul class="medium">
    <li>Websites that you visited, even in private mode</li>
    <li>Files that you opened, even if you deleted them</li>
    <li>Passwords, even if you use a password manager</li>
    <li>All the devices and Wi-Fi networks that you used</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="medium">On the contrary, Tails never writes anything to the hard
  disk and only runs from the memory of the computer. The memory is entirely
  deleted when you shutdown Tails, erasing all possible traces.</p>

  <h2>Encrypted Persistent Storage</h2>

  <p class="big">You can <strong>save some of your files and configuration</strong>
  in an encrypted Persistent Storage on the USB stick:
  your documents, your browser bookmarks, your emails, and
  even some additional software.</p>

  <p class="medium">The Persistent Storage is optional and you always decide what is
  <i>persistent</i>. Everything else is <i>amnesic</i>.</p>

  <h2>Digital security toolbox</h2>

  <p class="big">Tails includes a selection of applications to <strong>work on sensitive documents</strong>
  and <strong>communicate securely</strong>.</p>

  <p class="big">All the applications
  are ready-to-use and are configured with safe defaults to <strong>prevent
  mistakes</strong>.</p>

  <p class="medium">Tails includes:</p>

  <ul class="medium">
    <li><i>Tor Browser</i> with <i>uBlock</i>, a secure browser and an ad-blocker</li>
    <li><i>Thunderbird</i>, for encrypted emails</li>
    <li><i>KeePassXC</i>, to create and store strong passwords</li>
    <li><i>LibreOffice</i>, an office suite</li>
    <li><i>OnionShare</i>, to share files over Tor</li>
    <li>and many more!</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="medium">To prevent mistakes:</p>

  <ul class="medium">
    <li>Applications are blocked automatically if they try to connect to the Internet without Tor.</li>
    <li>Everything in the Persistent Storage is encrypted automatically.</li>
    <li>Tails does not write anything to the hard disk. All the memory is deleted when shutting down.</li>

  <h2>Tor for everything</h2>

  <p class="big">Everything you do on the Internet from Tails goes through the Tor
  network. Tor encrypts and anonymizes your connection by
  <strong>passing it through 3 relays</strong>. <i>Relays</i> are servers
  operated by different people and organizations around the world.</p>

  <p class="medium">A single relay never knows both where the encrypted
  connection is coming from and where it is going to:</p>

  <ul class="medium">
    <li>The 1st relay only knows where you are coming from but not where
    you are going to.</li>
    <li>This 3rd relay only knows where you are going to but not where
    you are coming from.</li>
    <li>The connection to the final destination is encrypted whenever
    possible to prevent the 3rd relay from reading its content.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="medium">This way, Tor is <strong>secure by design</strong> even if a few
  relays are malicious.</p>

  <p class="medium">Tor has more than 6&#8239;000 relays. Organizations running Tor relays
  include universities like the MIT, activist groups like Riseup,
  nonprofits like Derechos Digitales, Internet hosting companies like
  Private Internet Access, etc. The huge diversity of people and
  organizations running Tor relays makes it more secure and more
  sustainable.</p>

  <h2>Avoid online surveillance and censorship</h2>

  <p class="big">Tor prevents someone watching your Internet connection from learning
  <strong><i>what</i> you are doing on the Internet</strong>.</p>

  <p class="big">You can avoid
  censorship because it is <strong>impossible for a censor to know</strong> which
  websites you are visiting.</p>

  <p class="medium">If connecting to Tor is blocked or dangerous to use from where you
  are, for example Iran or China, you can use <i>bridges</i> to connect to
  Tor in a more discrete way. Different types of bridges work better in
  different places.</p>

  <h2>Avoid tracking and change identity</h2>

  <p class="big">Tor also prevents the websites that you are visiting from learning
  <strong><i>where</i> and <i>who</i> you are</strong>, unless you tell them. You
  can visit websites <strong>anonymously or change your identity</strong>.</p>

  <p class="big">Online
  trackers and advertisers won't be able to follow you around from one website to another
  anymore.</p>

  <p class="medium">You can publish a blog or manage a social media
  account entirely from Tails. If you only access it from
  Tails, it cannot be related to you. You can store documents
  and images related to this different identity in your Persistent Storage,
  keep your passwords in <i>KeePassXC</i>, have a dedicated
  email account in <i>Thunderbird</i>, etc.</p>
