Releases
========

* [[Tails 3.11 was released on December 11|news/version_3.11]] (bugfix release).

* Tails 3.12 is [[scheduled for January 29|contribute/calendar]].

The following changes were introduced in Tails 3.11:

- Add a confirm dialog between downloading and applying an automatic
  upgrade to control better when the network is disabled and prevent
  partially applied upgrades. ([[!tails_ticket 14754]] and
  [[!tails_ticket 15282]])

- When running from a virtual machine, warn about the trustworthiness of
  the operating system even when running from a free virtualization
  software. ([[!tails_ticket 16195]])

- Disable *Autocrypt* in *Thunderbird* to prevent sending unencrypted
  emails by mistake. ([[!tails_ticket 15923]])

- Fix the opening of *Thunderbird* in non-English languages. ([[!tails_ticket 16113]])

- Reduce the logging level of Tor when using bridges. ([[!tails_ticket 15743]])

Code
====

- We continued working on releasing Tails using a disk image format.
  This will make it easier to install Tails on Windows and macOS. Part
  of this work was to switch our IDF format to JSON and to rewrite and
  [release a new version of the Tails verification
  extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tails-verification/gaghffbplpialpoeclgjkkbknblfajdl).

- Updated onionshare, torsocks and tails-installer in Debian.

Hot topics on our help desk
===========================

1. Black screen after the boot menu with Intel GPU (i915) [[!tails_ticket #16224]]

2. Partially applied incremental upgrades cause all kinds of trouble [[!tails_ticket #14754]]

Infrastructure
==============

- We planned the final steps to make our web translation platform
  production-ready.

  hefee, emmapeel and our sysadmins have continued working on integrating the
  translation platform into our infrastructure. The translation server (not yet
  in production) now updates its Git repository automatically using scripts.
  A staging website shows translators how their translation will look like in
  context, once merged into our master branch. The staging website (not yet in
  production either) is updated automatically.

- We kept working on our new server backup setup, which now works
  fine in production.

- Our mailing lists were migrated to new providers (puscii,
  Autistici/Inventati, and some self-hosted on our own
  infrastructure). Many thanks to boum.org for the support in the last
  ten years. Thanks as well to puscii and Austistici/Inventati for
  stepping up now.

- We started running the authoritative nameserver for a couple of Tails
  DNS zones.

Funding
=======

We continued working on our yearly donation campaign:

* We added support for [[4 new cryptocurrencies|news/new_cryptocurrencies]].

* We wrote about [[our plans for 2019|news/plans_for_2019]].

* We closed our donation campaign but we don't have the final
  numbers yet.
