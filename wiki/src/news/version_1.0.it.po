"* Security fixes\n"
"  - Upgrade the web browser to 24.5.0esr-0+tails1~bpo60+1\n"
"    (Firefox 24.5.0esr + Iceweasel patches + Torbrowser patches).\n"
"  - Upgrade Tor to 0.2.4.21-1+tails1~d60.squeeze+1:\n"
"    * Based on 0.2.4.21-1~d60.squeeze+1.\n"
"    * Backport the fix for [[!tor_bug 11464]]. It adds client-side\n"
"      blacklists for all Tor directory authority keys that was\n"
"      vulnerable to Heartbleed.  This protects clients in case\n"
"      attackers were able to compromise a majority of the authority\n"
"      signing and identity keys.\n"

"* Bugfixes\n"
"  - Disable inbound I2P connections. Tails already restricts incoming\n"
"    connections, but this change tells I2P about it.\n"
"  - Fix link to the system requirements documentation page in the Tails\n"
"    Upgrader error shown when too little RAM is available.\n"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#, no-wrap
msgid ""
"* Minor improvements\n"
"  - Upgrade I2P to 0.9.12-2~deb6u+1.\n"
"  - Import TorBrowser profile. This was forgotten in Tails 0.23 and even\n"
"    though we didn't explicitly set those preferences in that release\n"
"    they defaulted to the same values. This future-proofs us in case the\n"
"    defaults would ever change.\n"
"  - Import new custom version of Tor Launcher:\n"
"    * Based on upstream Tor Launcher 0.2.5.3.\n"
"    * Improve how Tor Launcher handles incomplete translation.\n"
"      ([[!tor_bug 11483]]; more future-proof fix for\n"
"      [[!tails_ticket 6885]])\n"
"    * Remove the bridge settings prompt. ([[!tor_bug 11482]]; closes\n"
"      [[!tails_ticket 6934]])\n"
"    * Always show bridge help button. ([[!tor_bug 11484]])\n"
"  - Integrate the new Tails logo into various places:\n"
"    * The website\n"
"    * The boot splash\n"
"    * The \"About Tails\" dialog\n"
