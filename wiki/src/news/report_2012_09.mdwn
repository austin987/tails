[[!meta title="Tails report for September, 2012"]]

September, 2012 has been pretty busy for Tails. Here is a report of what
happened.

Releases
========

Tails 0.13 was released on September 18th. See the [[announcement for more
details|version_0.13]].

The release came out one week late compared to the initial schedule.
This is due to an unexpected late arrival of the updated Iceweasel ESR
backported packages.

The next release, labeled 0.14, should be released by the end of
October. A first release candidate should be available for testing on
the 9th.

People
======

Tails has been started and successfully connected to the Tor network
around 71.000 times in September. That makes a boot every 36 seconds on
average. This number is an approximation from the requests made for the
security announcements feed. The later is retrieved by Tails after being
connected to Tor to eventually encourage users to update.

47 reports were received through WhisperBack.

The forum activity went pretty crazy with 1038 new messages, 156 of them
signed by "Tails". Not the highest signal/noise ratio in history,
though.

Code
====

A fix was merged for the [[slow browsing experience of the
documentation|todo/faster_offline_documentation_browsing]] available inside
Tails systems.

Some progress was made on the front of [[supporting multiple
kernels|todo/nx_bit]], that should lead a future version of Tails to use
multiple cores and more than 3GB of memory eventually, as well as fixing most
of the dreaded "not all memory is wiped at shutdown" bug.

A first attempt to tackle [[persistent connections in Network
Manager|todo/persistence_preset_-_NM_connections]] is available for reviews.

'Old style' [[PC speaker is now disabled|todo/disable_pc_speaker]] to prevent
loud, unexpected beeps.

The [Unsafe Web browser now disables all Iceweasel
extensions](http://git.immerda.ch/?p=amnesia.git;a=commit;h=64da202).

The [[firewall is now configured using `ferm`|todo/ferm]].

The [build process is now more likely to fail instead of letting errors
slip](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2012-September/001634.html)
when hooks fail.

Tails (`devel` Git branch) is now [[using Tor 0.2.3|todo/Tor_0.2.3]].

One of the new feature of Tor 0.2.3 is network stream isolation.
Subsequent [[anonymity enhancements have been
implemented|todo/separate_Tor_streams]] and will be available in Tails 0.14.

The [[readahead breakage|todo/fix_background_readahead]] resulting in a
noticeable pause during startup has been fixed.

The [Vagrant-based build system was
optimized](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2012-September/001594.html).

Some more work has been done in [improving handling of init
scripts](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2012-September/001643.html).

The bug that made the [[default search engine for some languages fallback on
Google|bugs/languages_without_a_localized_Startpage_get_Google_by_default]] has
been fixed.

Some [more build system optimization related to package
installation](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2012-September/001718.html).

An [input method for Japanese has been
added](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2012-September/001719.html)
and will be in Tails 0.14.

[[Programs used by default to open downloaded files were often
sub-optimal|todo/open_mp3_with_totem_instead_of_audacity]]. The issue is now
fixed.

A [bug resulting in whisperback reporting an inexistent
error](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2012-September/001621.html)
during the send process has been fixed.

On the OpenPGP smartcards support front, some backports were prepared
and are being tested.

On-going discussions
====================

[Two contributors interested in working on Tails server showed
up](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2012-September/001559.html).

Some [feedback and comments about the 'uwt'
script](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2012-September/001575.html)
shipped in Whonix.

Documentation and website
=========================

The documentation has received several small improvements in the
following areas:

 * List what can be done when Tails does not start.
 * Better phrasing of the disclaimer about TrueCrypt.
 * Adjust TrueCrypt documentation for the current boot menu.
 * Specify what happens to the persistent volume when using
   the clone option of the installer.
 * Be more explicit of what should be done after installing
   Tails.
 * Link more appropriately the Torrent OpenPGP signature.

An important amount of (still invisible) work has been done to replace
the forum with a Q&A-style (like StackOverflow) web application that
would suit our needs (and possibly the Tor project's ones -- we'll see).

Translations
============

The French translations has received a sturdy stream of updates.

The website is currently at:

 * FR: 79% translated, 1% fuzzy
 * PT: 50% translated, 1% fuzzy
 * ES: 28% translated, 3% fuzzy
 * DE: 13% translated, 1% fuzzy

Infrastructure
==============

The `tails::whisperback::relay` Puppet class was brought into working
state. This allowed us to setup additional WhisperBack relays:
fail-over should now ensure bug reporting is possible most of
the time. See Git repository at:
`git://webmasters.boum.org/tails-puppet-module-tails`

The server that will be dedicated to Tails development needs was
delivered and plugged in the SeaCCP colocation. Many thanks to our
friends at Riseup, who helped a lot through the whole process, and to
the Tor project, who supports us once again by funding the
server hosting! Debian Wheezy was installed.

A Redmine install was setup at Riseup Labs to allow us to evaluate it.
Thanks a lot, again!

Funding
=======

The discussions with sponsor Bravo are going well. It's likely that
around 20 days of work for two developers will be funded by
the end of November.
