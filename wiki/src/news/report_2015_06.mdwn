The release date for Tails 1.4.1 had been postponed because Mozilla changed
their release schedule.  It was released in the beginning of July. Once again, this report 
consists of non-code news :)

[[!toc]]

Releases
========

* The next release (1.5) is [[planned for August 11|contribute/calendar/]].

* We decided on a new [[version number scheme|contribute/release_schedule#versioning]].

Documentation and website
=========================

* A small note about non-free firmware was added to our [[licence page|doc/about/license]].

* Our [[documentation for reviewers|contribute/merge_policy/review]] now
  explains how to do a good and nice review.

* We warn that *OpenPGP Applet* can lead to
  [[encoding problems for emails|doc/encryption_and_privacy/gpgapplet/public-key_cryptography#encoding]].

User experience
===============

- On the [[Installation Assistant|blueprint/bootstrapping/assistant]]:
  - We wrote a full synopsis of the [[installation process for
    Windows|blueprint/bootstrapping/assistant/windows]], submitted it for
    review, and started testing it ([[!tails_ticket 9202 desc="#9202"]]).
  - We started writing an ikiwiki and Bootstrap prototype of the Installation
    Assistant in web/assistant.

* People are working on the [Greeter mockups](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-ux/2015-June/000437.html).

Infrastructure
==============

* Our test suite covers 182 scenarios, just as in May. We removed outdated
  scenarios again, so there are actually new tests :) New tests add coverage
  for the Tor Browser's _New Identity_ feature and confirm that the hardware clock is not 
  updated by Tails. Additionally, a huge amount of work was put into making our test suite
  more robust.

* We decided to publicly archive the tails-support mailing list, since external
  websites were archiving it anyway.

* Great progress was made towards automatically [[!tails_ticket 6196 desc="building all active branches"]]
  with Jenkins. Live deployment is now a matter of days.

* We have [[!tails_ticket 8649 desc="specified"]] the requirements for our
  upcoming monitoring system.

Funding
=======

* If you want to help us develop and maintain Tails, please [[donate|donate]] :)

* We sent our final report for the Access Innovation Prize received in
  March 2014.

* We submitted our second quarterly report to the
  [Digital Defenders Partnership](https://digitaldefenders.org/).

Outreach
========

  took place on June 18th in Brest, France.

* Tchou and Fiodor Tonti gave [a talk about Tails and UX](https://www.passageenseine.org/fr/programme/2015/jeudi-18-juin/grande-salle/atelier-design-tails)
in Pas Sage en Seine 2015 at NUMA in Paris, France on June 18th. [The
video](https://www.passageenseine.org/fr/archives-et-videos/) and [[slides|contribute/how/promote/material/slides/PSES15-20150618/UX_et_logiciels_libres.pdf]] are online and it has already received positive feedback. :)

Upcoming events
---------------

* A talk about Tails will take place during
  [DebConf15](http://debconf15.debconf.org/) in August in Heidelberg, Germany.

* Please let us know if you organize an event about Tails, we'll be glad to announce it :)

On-going discussions
====================

* [We discussed our release versioning](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2015-June/009132.html)
  and decided upon a new way to do it: always increment the first number with major
  Debian version, or whenever it makes sense for Tails only (user-visible
  changes); second number: even for bugfix releases, odd for major ones; an
  extra 3rd number will be added for emergency releases.

* intrigeri started a discussion about [tightening a bit the Evince and Totem AppArmor policy](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2015-June/009007.html).

* genghiskant proposed [making a fork of Tails without non-free firmware](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2015-June/009023.html).

* We're talking about the design of a [persistent Tor state](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2015-June/009095.html).

* We're also discussing the [automated tests specification](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2015-June/009123.html).

Press and testimonials
======================

* We gave an interview to Amaelle Guiton from
  Libération about [our relationship with the Tor
  ecosystem](http://www.liberation.fr/economie/2015/06/18/tor-mails-toi-de-tes-oignons_1332660).

* We provided some data to Patrick Howell O'Neill from The Daily Dot for
  his article about [The state of encryption tools, 2 years after Snowden leaks](https://www.dailydot.com/politics/encryption-since-snowden-trending-up/).
