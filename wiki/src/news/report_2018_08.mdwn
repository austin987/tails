Tails Summit, 2018
==================

Once a year a dozen or two Tails contributors meet in person to shape
the project and define our priorities. This year, we met in August and
enjoyed one week of discussions, skill sharing and hands-on work
sessions. A great number of uninvited mosquitoes joined us as well but
we managed to find efficient mitigation measures :)

Releases
========

* Tails 3.10 is [[scheduled for October 23|contribute/calendar]].

Code
====

- We organized the [[contribute/working_together/roles/Foundations_Team]] biggest tasks for the end of the year: porting Tails to Buster, [[!tails_ticket 15349 desc="migrate away from vmdebootstrap"]], [[!tails_ticket 15460 desc="make our test suite work with Java 9+"]], [[!tails_ticket 8415 desc="migrate from `aufs` to `overlayfs`"]], [[!tails_ticket 15281 desc="improve the upgrade UX"]].
- We completed lots of work in time for Tails 3.9:
  - Updated *Tor Browser* to 8.0, based on *Firefox* 60 ESR.
  - Updated *Thunderbird* from 52 to [60](https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/60.0/releasenotes/).
  - Updated *Tor* to 0.3.4.7-rc.
  - Updated *Linux* to 4.17 which also fixes the
    [Foreshadow](https://foreshadowattack.eu/) attack.
  - Use *Tor Browser* again for browsing the documentation offline.
    ([[!tails_ticket 15720]])
- We fixed a number of regressions identified in Tails 3.9~rc1.
- We worked on making our branch based on Debian 10 (Buster)
  build again. ([[!tails_ticket 15857]])

Documentation and website
=========================

We documented how to:

- [[Install additional software|doc/first_steps/additional_software]].

- [[Unlock VeraCrypt volumes|doc/encryption_and_privacy/veracrypt]].

- Fix [[Persistent folder disappearing and persistent feature
  configurations not loading|support/known_issues#persistence-disappears]].

- Fix [[Tails behaving weirdly if an automatic upgrade is only
  partially applied|support/known_issues#partial-upgrade]].

- Calculate the [[food budget for contributors attending events
  on behalf of Tails|contribute/sponsorship_to_attend_events]].

User experience
===============

- We presented a first version of our personas to the community and
  agreed on focusing on [[Riou, The Censorship
  Evader|blueprint/personas#riou]], as our primary persona.

<a href="https://git.tails.boum.org/ux/plain/personas/posters.pdf"><img src="https://git.tails.boum.org/ux/plain/personas/posters.png"></a>

- We completed the [[collaboration with Simply
  Secure|blueprint/explain_tails/simsec]] on the Tails identity (aka.
  "brand") and making it easier to understand what is Tails and how it
  works. This work lays the foundation to:

  - Redefining our visual style and tone.
  - [[Explanation of Tails|blueprint/explain_tails]] on our home and about pages.

  We will report on this in more details later.

- We improved the readability of our HTML tables. See for example
  [[support/known_issues/graphics]].

Hot topics on our help desk
===========================

Like in previous months, most users writing to Help Desk are having issues with hardware support.

1. Several users reported hard or soft lockups with recent Dell XPS
   and other laptops with recent NVIDIA graphics cards. We're still
   waiting for more test results before we can document a workaround.
   ([[!tails_ticket 15774]])

1. Some problems were also reported with some Intel graphics cards on Tails 3.9~rc1.
   This was fixed in Tails 3.9. ([[!tails_ticket 15821]])

1. Many users still lose temporarily their persistence configuration.
   To fix this, see [[the documented workaround|support/known_issues/#persistence-disappears]].
