Releases
========

* Tails 3.14 is [[scheduled for May 21|contribute/calendar]].

Code
====

- The [[Foundations
  Team|contribute/working_together/roles/foundations_team]] met for
  a sprint focused on porting Tails to Debian 10 (Buster):
  [report](https://lists.autistici.org/message/20190408.075929.1c2952c0.en.html),
  [next
  steps](https://lists.autistici.org/message/20190429.091241.82e34497.en.html).
- We finalized our criteria for including dictionaries, fonts and language packs,
  which will be reflected in Tails 3.14.
- We prototyped a USB image with Secure Boot support and GRUB, in order
  to better understand what implementation difficulties we should expect.
- We
  [submitted](https://ikiwiki.info/todo/_Add_ikiwiki_PO-Plugin_to_ignore_languages/)
  to ikiwiki upstream a branch that makes it keep PO files up-to-date
  for a set of languages that are not ready to be enabled and visible
  on the live website yet. This will allow us to merge into our main
  Git repository changes made via our upcoming Weblate-based
  translation platform, which supports languages whose
  work-in-progress translation is not ready for prime-time yet.
- We
  [uploaded](https://tracker.debian.org/news/1038188/accepted-gnome-shell-3302-6-source-into-unstable/)
  to Debian a few fixes for regressions in the GNOME on-screen keyboard.

Hot topics on our help desk
===========================

1. Some users reported loosing the access to their persistent volume ([#10976](https://redmine.tails.boum.org/code/issues/10976))
1. A few reported the "USB stick becomes unbootable boot after first boot" issue  
([#16389](https://redmine.tails.boum.org/code/issues/16389))
1. Some issues caused by partially applied incremental upgrades ([#14754](https://redmine.tails.boum.org/code/issues/14754))

Infrastructure
==============

- The Foundations Team started experimenting with GitLab for
  [merge requests](https://salsa.debian.org/tails-team/tails/merge_requests/?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=merged).
- We started looking into how GitLab could work for our issues
  tracking and [[drafted a rough plan|blueprint/GitLab]].

Funding
=======

- We started working on a proposal for [Mozilla Open Source Support
  Awards](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/moss/).

On-going discussions
====================

- We [studied and narrowed down our
  options](https://lists.autistici.org/message/20190429.094536.22d3598f.en.html)
  regarding the future of Electrum in Tails. It seems there will be
  a way forward, although it's unclear at this point how much effort
  it will require from us.
