Releases
========

* [[Tails 3.3 was released on November 14th|news/version_3.3]] (minor release).

* We will not make an emergency release for the latest Tor Browser update, because Tails is [[!tails_ticket 15018 desc="not affected"]].

* Tails 3.5 is [[scheduled for January 16th|contribute/calendar]].

Code
====

* We fixed issues regarding reproducible builds
  ([[!tails_ticket 14924]], [[!tails_ticket 14946]],
  [[!tails_ticket 14933]]) and later realized that one of them fixes
  did not work in some corner cases… that include the ISO images we
  build for the Tails official releases. Sadly, due to an internal
  communication mishap we've announced that Tails 3.3 was reproducible
  before we had learned about this remaining problem.

* We uploaded a new version of tails-installer (5.0.2) to Debian and Ubuntu.
  This version has a simpler interface than previous versions.

Documentation and website
=========================

* We have documented internally how active Tails contributors can be
  sponsored to attend events on behalf of Tails and are now working
  towards publishing this documentation so that all contributors are
  aware of this option ([[!tails_ticket 14727]]).

User experience
===============

- We almost finished the work on the new download page and verification
  extension for Firefox and Chrome. We're stuck blocked by security
  reviews and improvements on the JavaScript code.

- Our survey on file storage encryption was answered 1012 times between
  October 17 and December 1. It was a huge success and we'll now move on
  to analyzing the results.

Hot topics on our help desk
===========================
 
1. [[!tails_ticket 14968 desc="#14968: Ublock is not working in Tails 3.3"]]

Infrastructure
==============

- Our test suite covers 209 scenarios, 2 more that in October.
- Cyril Brulebois (kibi) published a [blog post about his early work on reproducible builds](https://debamax.com/blog/2017/11/20/tails-early-work-on-reproducibility/).

Funding
=======

* We submitted a funding request for the Secure Operating Systems
  Summit that we are organizing with Qubes OS, Subgraph OS and Whonix.

* We applied to the "Good of the Internet" call for proposals by RIPE
  NCC. Our proposal is titled "Interoperability and communication
  continuity between mobile, laptop and desktop computers, in privacy
  and security-sensitive environments".

* We continued to run our donation campaign.
