Releases
========

* No Tails version was released in December 2017.

* We updated our [[release schedule for 2018|contribute/calendar]].

Code
====

* We published our [[plans for 2018|news/our_plans_for_2018]].

* We started improving the backend of the [[*Additional Software*|doc/first_steps/persistence/configure#additional_software]] persistent
  feature. We worked on:

  - Not blocking the opening of the desktop ([[!tails_ticket 9059]],
  [[Blueprint|blueprint/additional_software_packages/dont_block_desktop_startup]]).
  - Making it work offline ([[!tails_ticket 14570]],
  [[Blueprint|blueprint/additional_software_packages/offline_mode]]).

Documentation and website
=========================

* Cody and sajolida started fixing issues identified in the expert review
  done by jaster on our installation instructions in August:

  - Solve all the smaller issues.
  - Create tickets for all remaining issues on Redmine. ([[!tails_ticket 14548]])
  - Make plans to [[restructure our support page|blueprint/support_page]] in depth.

* We wrote design documents for our [[installation
  instructions|contribute/design/installation_assistant]] and [[verification
  extension (*Tails Verification*)|contribute/design/verification_extension]].

User experience
===============

## New download page

We completely redesigned our [[download page|install/download]]. This work was
triggered by the rewrite of *Tails Verification* (our browser extension) into
*Web Extensions* but the result improves the overall experience.

*Tails Verification* is also now available for Chrome.

## UX work on VeraCrypt in GNOME

We designed the user experience for our work on the integration of *VeraCrypt* in GNOME.

1. We [[analyzed the results of our online survey|blueprint/veracrypt#survey]].

2. We did some paper prototypes of the interactions and tested them with users.

Hot topics on our help desk
===========================

1. [[!tails_ticket 15024 desc="Printing to PDF with Tor Browser does not work anymore"]]

Infrastructure
==============

 - We have converted two sources of email sent by cron with Icinga 2
   monitoring checks that are easier to track and fine-tune
   ([[!tails_ticket 11598]], [[!tails_ticket 12455]]).

 - We have fixed a longstanding bug that made the UX of our CI system
   confusing when deleting a branch in Git ([[!tails_ticket 15069]]).

 - We have set up a local email server on every Jenkins node that runs
   automated ISO tests, as a first step towards making our automatic
   _Thunderbird_ tests more robust ([[!tails_ticket 12277]]).

 - We have tuned our servers to get a little bit better performance
   out of our CI system ([[!tails_ticket 15054]]).

 - We have [[extended the blueprint about upgrading the hardware for
   automated tests|blueprint/hardware_for_automated_tests_take3/]].

Outreach
========

Past events
-----------

 - 34c3: A fair number of Tails developers and contributors attended
   the [[34th Chaos Communication Congress (34c3)|https://events.ccc.de/congress/2017/wiki/index.php/Main_Page]]
   in Leipzig.
   During this event, we set up a table to meet with interested parties-
   users, contributors, or anyone interested.
   We were able to reach both newcomers and long-time users of Tails,
   answer questions, help, exchange stickers, give away USB keys and
   t-shirts in exchange of donations, get feedback or just chat.
   It was, of course, also a great opportunity to meet people in person,
   discuss, work, and have fun both within the project and with friend projects.

Upcoming events
---------------

 - We will have a booth [[at FOSDEM|http://fosdem.org/2018]] in Brussels on February 3&ndash;4.

 - sajolida will be at the [Internet Freedom Festival](https://internetfreedomfestival.org/) in Valencia on March 5&ndash;9.
