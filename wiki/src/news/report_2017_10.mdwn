Code
====

- We started evaluating our options regarding a possible
  [[!tails_ticket 14789 desc="upgrade to Linux 4.13"]]
  in Tails 3.3.

- We had a first sprint to evaluate how it would be like if Tails was
  [[based on quarterly snapshots of Debian testing|blueprint/Debian_testing]]:
  - We ported most of Tails to Debian Buster.
  - We adjusted most of our test suite accordingly.
  - We designed a [[!tails_ticket 14791 desc="process"]] and
    implemented [[!tails_ticket 14579 desc="tools"]] that will allow
    us to tell technical writers what part of the documentation is
    affected by changes in our code, test suite, or installed packages.
  - We adapted the Debian Security Tracker code to
    [[!tails_ticket 14823 desc="track security issues fixed in Debian but not in the snapshots Tails uses"]].
  - In November we will check how we are doing and will decide what
    the next steps shall be.

Documentation and website
=========================

- We improved our donation page in preparation of the donation campaign
  to mention CCT instead of Zwiebelfreunde and be better structured.

User experience
===============

- We installed [*LimeSurvey* on our infrastructure](https://survey.tails.boum.org)
  and advertised a first survey on file storage encryption from the homepage of
  *Tor Browser* in Tails. Our users have been [very responsive to our
  call](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-ux/2017-October/003505.html)
  and since then we have gathered 30 complete answers to the survey each
  day on average, reaching 375 in total on October 30.

- We extensively tested older and newer versions of UUI to understand why
  [[!tails_ticket 13206 desc="cloning from a USB stick installed using UUI
  sometimes fails"]]. Everything is fine as long as "*Format in FAT32*" is
  checked which is documented but not always applied by users, so we should
  either improve UUI, our documentation, or *Tails Greeter* to prevent that.

- We continued to port our verification extension for Firefox to Web
  Extensions and [we now have a working prototype](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2017-October/011817.html)!
  that computes the checksum in a reasonable time (45 seconds).

Hot topics on our help desk
===========================

1. [Tails Installer treats drives differently depending on when they are plugged](https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/14755)

1. [Install by cloning sometimes silently fails from a stick installed with UUI](https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/13206)

1. A few users with Nvidia graphics reported some issues.

Infrastructure
==============

- We consolidated our system administration team by hiring a new
  member. Welcome, groente!

- For our installation of *LimeSurvey*, we implemented an automatic monitoring
  of new upstream versions to notify system administrators when a security
  update is available ([Git repository](https://git-tails.immerda.ch/monitor-limesurvey-releases)).

Funding
=======

- The proposal that we submitted to the [Lush Digital Fund](https://uk.lush.com/article/introducing-digital-fund)
  in May was accepted. It will fund the integration of a web-based translation
  platform in the build of our website and documentation.

- We published our [[finances for 2016|doc/about/finances#2016]].

- We launched our 2017 donation campaign and blogged about [[Many hands make
  Tails|news/many_hands_make_tails]].
