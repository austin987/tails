[[!meta title="Tails report from September to December 2015"]]

The last report about august has been published a short while ago and now we present to you the combined reports from September to December 2015. We were quite busy and didn't find the time to write seperate reports since August 2015.
This report covers the last third of 2015.

Releases
========

* [[Tails 1.6 was released on September 22, 2015.|news/version_1.6]] (major release)

* [[Tails 1.7 was released on November 3, 2015.|news/version_1.7]] (major release)

* [[Tails 1.8 was released on December 15, 2015.|news/version_1.8]] (major release)

* [[Tails 1.8.1 was released on December 19, 2015.|news/version_1.8.1]] (minor release)

Code
====

For details, see each release announcement. Notable changes include:

* 1.7: You can now start Tails in [[offline mode|doc/first_steps/startup_options/offline_mode]]
       to disable all networking for additional security. Doing so can be
       useful when working on sensitive documents.

* 1.8: <span class="application">[[Icedove|doc/anonymous_internet/icedove]]</span>, a
       rebranded version of <span class="application">Mozilla Thunderbird</span>, is
       now the official email client in Tails, replacing
       <span class="application">Claws Mail</span>.
       As with Claws, Icedove allows you to encrypt and decrypt emails easily and sends all
       traffic through the Tor network.

Infrastructure
==============

  - We were able to deploy automated tests of ISO images built
    automatically for our main release branches in the beginning of
    October.

  - The new snapshot system improved robustness of our test suite
    noticeably, and reduced the amount of time needed for a full run
    with at least 30%.

User experience
===============

  - Alan wrote a prototype for a new version of Tails Greeter and we
    [conducted user testing](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-ux/2015-November/000791.html) of it.

  - Lunar started a discussion on [redesigning the process to connect to a
    network and configure Tor](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-ux/2015-October/000659.html).

  - sajolida proposed some improvements to WhisperBack regarding [language
    flagging and OpenPGP keys](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-ux/2015-November/000801.html).

Documentation and website
=========================

- We published our [[Installation Assistant|install]] to make it easier
  to get started with Tails.

- Giorgio Maone wrote a [Firefox add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tails-download-and-verify/?src=search)
  to verify the Tails ISO image automatically.

- We published a statement [[about creating Tails derivatives|contribute/derivatives]].
