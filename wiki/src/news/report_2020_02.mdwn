Releases
========

* [[Tails 4.3 was released on February 11|news/version_4.3]]. (bugfix release)

* Tails 4.4 is [[scheduled for March 12|contribute/calendar]].

The following changes were introduced in Tails 4.3:

- We included the `trezor` package, which provides a command line tool
  to use a Trezor hardware wallet for cryptocurrencies.

- Fix the progress bar and prevent closing the window while an upgrade
  is being applied. ([[!tails_ticket 16603]])

Code
====

- We made great progress on Secure boot support ([[!tails_ticket 6560]])
  and are now quite confident we can ship this in Tails 4.5 (April 7).

  Thanks to everyone who answered our call for testing!

- In order to make the development process a bit smoother, we improved the
  performance of our builds ([[!tails_ticket 17439]], [[!tails_ticket 17386]]).

- We kept working on replacing Sikuli in our test suite ([[!tails_ticket
  15460]]), which will allow running it on recent Debian systems.
  We're almost there! :)
