The Amnesic Incognito Live System, version 0.6.2, is out.

This is a bugfix-only release mainly aimed at fixing serious security
issues in bundled software. All users must upgrade as soon as
possible.

Notable changes include:

- Tor 0.2.1.29: resolves a bug that probably allows remote code
  execution; see the [Tor project blog
  post](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-02129-released-security-patches)
  for details.
- Other software upgrades fix grave bugs, some of these with serious
  security implications.
- Upgrade Claws Mail to 3.7.6 (new backport).
- Install Liferea, tcpdump and tcpflow.
- Seahorse: use hkp:// transport as it does not support hkps://.
- FireGPG: use hkps:// to connect to the configured keyserver.

See the [online
Changelog](https://git-tails.immerda.ch/tails/plain/debian/changelog?h=0.6.2)
for details.
