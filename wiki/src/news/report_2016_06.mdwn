Releases
========

* [[Tails 2.4 was released on June 7|news/version_2.4]] (major release).

* Tails 2.5 is [[scheduled for August 2|contribute/calendar]].

The following changes were introduced in Tails 2.4:

- We enabled the automatic account configuration of *Icedove* which
  discovers the correct parameters to connect to your email provider
  based on your email address. We improved it to rely only on secure
  protocol and we are working on sharing these improvements with Mozilla
  so that users of *Thunderbird* outside Tails can benefit from them as well.

- Remove the preconfigured `#tails` IRC channel. [[Join us on XMPP
  instead!|support/chat]]

- Always display minimize and maximize buttons in titlebars.
  ([[!tails_ticket 11270]])

- Remove *GNOME Tweak Tool* and *hledger*. You can add them back using
  the [[*Additional software
  packages*|doc/first_steps/persistence/configure#additional_software]]
  persistence feature.

- Use secure HKPS OpenPGP key server in *Enigmail*.

- Harden our firewall by rejecting `RELATED` packets and restricting Tor
  to only send `NEW` TCP `syn` packets. ([[!tails_ticket 11391]])

- Harden our kernel by:
  * Setting various security-related kernel options: `slab_nomerge slub_debug=FZ
    mce=0 vsyscall=none`. ([[!tails_ticket 11143]])
  * Removing the <span class="filename">.map</span> files of the kernel.
    ([[!tails_ticket  10951]])

- Update the *DRM* and *Mesa* graphical libraries. This should fix
  recent problems with starting Tails on some hardware. ([[!tails_ticket 11303]])

- Some printers that stopped working in Tails 2.0 should work again.
  ([[!tails_ticket 10965]])

- Enable Packetization Layer Path MTU Discovery for IPv4. This should
  make the connections to `obfs4` Tor bridges more reliable. ([[!tails_ticket 9268]])

- Remove our custom ciphers and MACs settings for SSH. This should fix
  connectivity issues with other distributions such as OpenBSD.
  ([[!tails_ticket 7315]])

- Fix the translations of *Tails Upgrader*. ([[!tails_ticket 10221]])

- Fix displaying the details of a circuit in *Onion Circuits* when using
  Tor bridges. ([[!tails_ticket 11195]])

  in the interface.

- How to allow [editing the configuration of a service](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-ux/2016-June/001024.html)
  in *Tails Server*.

Infrastructure
