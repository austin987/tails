Code
====

- We've continued our work on the [[!tails_ticket 14568 desc="Additional
  Software feature"]].

- We started [[!tails_ticket 11198 desc="replacing some of our shell scripts
  with Python ports"]]. Thanks to GoodCrypto & segfault!

Documentation and website
=========================

- We've improved the contributor's documentation for [[verifying reproducible ISO
  builds|contribute/release_process/test/reproducibility/verification]].

- We improved our [[installation instructions for Windows|install/win/usb]] to
  prevent people from skipping the *Fat32 Format* option of *Universal USB
  Installer*.

- We fixed our [[installation instructions for
  Ubuntu|install/debian/usb]] after the removal of the splash screen of
  *Tails Installer*.

User experience
===============

- We rethought in depth the installation process and made plans to [[distribute
  *USB images*|blueprint/usb_install_and_upgrade]] in addition to *ISO images*.
  Doing so will drastically simplify the installation for Windows and macOS
  and improve support for UEFI computers.

- We made plans to improve the user experience of Tails upgrades:
  - on the short term, we will make automatic upgrades more powerful
    to remove the need for any manual upgrade (except when releasing
    a version of Tails based on a new Debian release):
    [[!tails_ticket 15281]], [[Endless_upgrades#single-squashfs-diff]]
  - on the long term, we want to
    [[!tails_ticket desc="research" 15277]]
    existing system upgrade technologies

- We simplified the [[manual upgrade instructions from Tails|upgrade/tails]] to
  remove a whole step. Doing a manual upgrade should now be less confusing and
  take half the time!

- We [designed an error message](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-ux/2018-February/003531.html)
  when Tails is incompatible with a given graphics card. It will help users
  understand the failure better and get better help from our help desk.

Hot topics on our help desk
===========================

1. Users are still complaining about
   [[!tails_ticket desc="Electrum being outdated" 15022]]

2. A lot of reports are about the
   [[!tails_ticket desc="Tails Installer Unicode issue" 15254]]

Funding
=======

- We submitted a proposal for our work on [[distributing USB
  images|blueprint/usb_install_and_upgrade]] to the [ISC Project's 2018 Round
  of Small Technology Grants](https://iscproject.org/the-isc-projects-2018-round-of-small-technology-grants/).

- We renewed the agreement what have with Tor for them to pay for the hosting
  of our main server.
