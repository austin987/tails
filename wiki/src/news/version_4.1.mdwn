# Changes and upgrades

- Use <https://keys.openpgp.org/>, also available on
  <https://zkaan2xfbuxia2wpf7ofnkbz6r5zdbbvxbunvp5g2iebopbfc4iqmbad.onion/>,
  as the default OpenPGP keyserver.

  <div class="caution">

  <p>If you have GnuPG keys stored in Persistence since before Tails
  4.1, you should [[update your OpenPGP keyserver
  configuration|doc/encryption_and_privacy/openpgp_keyserver]] and adapt
  your Tails to this change.</p>

  </div>

- Update *Tor Browser* to 9.0.2.

- Update *Thunderbird* to from 60.9.0 to 68.2.2.

- Replace the [[*TorBirdy*
  extension|doc/anonymous_internet/thunderbird#torbirdy]] with custom
  settings and patches in *Thunderbird* that provide equivalent privacy.

- Update *Enigmail* to [2.1.3](https://enigmail.net/index.php/en/download/changelog),
  which has a simplified setup wizard that automatically creates an
  OpenPGP key for new email accounts.

- Update *Linux* to 5.3.9. This should improve the support for newer
  hardware (graphics, Wi-Fi, etc.).
