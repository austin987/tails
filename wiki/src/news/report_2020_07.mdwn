  is not installable on Buster anymore ([[!tails_ticket 17828]])

Documentation and website

  tethering|doc/anonymous_internet/networkmanager#no-wi-fi]] when Wi-Fi doesn't
  work in Tails. ([[!tails_ticket 16987]])

User experience

  Pidgin. ([[!tails_ticket 17821]])

  We got more than 600 responses so far. Thanks a lot to everybody who
  participated!

Hot topics on our help desk
===========================

We started the month with Tails 4.8 and many users wrote to us because of problems with the Tails Welcome Screen:

1. They had issues with [[!tails_ticket 17792 desc="administration passwords that had special characters"]].

1. They could not access their persistent storage because [[!tails_ticket 17794 desc="changing the language on the Welcome Screen didn't change the keyboard layout"]] as usual, although it claimed to do it. 

These two issues were very upsetting for the users, although had easy workarounds. They are fixed in Tails 4.9 (Apologies!), but in the same time the kernel upgrade brought new issues (Re: Apologies!):

1. A lot of people reported the starting Tails was impossible since the upgrade to Tails 4.9 with their Intel Corporation [8086:22b0] [[!tails_ticket 16447#note_153909 desc="GPU"]].

1. Some people reported that their Wi-Fi adapter [[!tails_ticket 17786#note_152948 desc="was not working anymore"]].

Infrastructure
==============

- Put our [translation platform](https://translate.tails.boum.org/).
  back in sync' with Git
- Updated our Jenkins and its plugins ([[!tails_gitlab tails/sysadmin/-/issues/16955]])
- Improved our monitoring of download mirrors
- Ported detection of stalled issues/MRs to GitLab ([[!tails_mr 110]])

Funding
=======

- Our proposal to OTF on anti-censorship was paused due to [their budget
  problems](https://saveinternetfreedom.tech/).

- Our joint proposal with Tor to DRL was declined but invited to submit again
  next year.

- We applied to the [Mecenat Code
  Lutins](https://framaforms.org/mecenat-code-lutin-2020-1589209347) to
  work on usability improvements.

- We added Wordable and Exam Success as sponsors.

- We coded some A/B testing to measure the impact of a design change on our
  one-time and monthly donations buttons. ([[!tails_gitweb_commit 52a2d90a42]])
