Documentation and website
=========================

- We tested all our documentation against the beta version of Tails 4.0, based
  on Debian 10 (Buster) and started fixing it.

Infrastructure
==============

- Our [web translation platform](https://translate.tails.boum.org/)
  reached an important milestone: translations done there will now
  automatically appear on the Tails website within hours.
  Expect a more detailed announcement and documentation for
  translators soon! :)

- As part of our ongoing effort to migrate to better maintained Puppet modules,
  we [[!tails_ticket 15510 desc="ported our infrastructure to puppetlabs-apt"]].

- We programmed an automated reminder to send our [[Code of
  Conduct|contribute/working_together/code_of_conduct]] to all our public
  mailing lists every 3 months.
