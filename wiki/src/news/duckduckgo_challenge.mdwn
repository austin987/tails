Through our end-of-year donation campaign we managed to raise
~103&thinsp;000€, which is nearly half of our yearly budget for core work and
maintenance. A big thanks to everybody who donated!

To fill the gap, we are extremely happy to be part of [DuckDuckGo's
privacy crowdrising
challenge](https://spreadprivacy.com/duckduckgo-privacy-challenge-2018/).

If you haven't donated to Tails recently, now is a great opportunity to
support us as your donation is likely to be matched by DuckDuckGo. It
will also help us get one of the grand prizes awarded by DuckDuckGo, up
to $50&thinsp;000.

What is Tails?
--------------

Tails is an entire operating system which preserves your privacy and
provides anonymity out-of-the-box. With Tails, you can use the Internet
anonymously and circumvent censorship. You'll be in control about the
traces you want to leave and those that you'd rather see forgotten.
Installed onto a USB key, Tails discreetly fits into your pocket.

For the past 9 years, we've been working on making digital security
accessible to those who need it most. Counting more than 20&thinsp;000 boots
per day, we've proved that Tails is a reliable and successful tool that
helps diverse people around the world to be safe online every day. But
we think that the immense work we've done until now should have an even
bigger impact on the world!

Even if you're not a Tails user yourself, your donation will [[help human
rights defenders, journalists, activists, victims of domestic violence
and many others|who_are_you_helping/]] who rely on Tails every day.

Another detail that makes our work awesome is that we contribute our
improvements back to the free software community. When donating to
Tails, you're supporting an entire ecosystem which we are part of.
