Releases
========

* [[Tails 3.0 was released on June 13|news/version_3.0]] (major release).

* Tails 3.1 is [[scheduled for August 8|contribute/calendar]].

Tails 3.0 is the first version of Tails based on Debian 9 (Stretch).
It brings a completely new startup and shutdown experience, a lot of
polishing to the desktop, security improvements in depth, and major
upgrades to a lot of the included software. We cannot list all the
improvements it brings here (see the
[[announcement|news/version_3.0]]), but let's still highlight a few
major changes:

- *Tails Greeter*, the application to configure Tails at startup, has
  been completely redesigned for ease of use.
- The shutdown experience has also been redesigned in order to be
  more reliable and more discrete.
- Tails 3.0 works on <span
  class="definition">[[!wikipedia x86-64 desc="64-bit computers"]]</span>
  only and not on 32-bit computers anymore.

Code
====

Thanks to
[multiprocess](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/Multiprocess_Firefox)
Firefox, we started working on
[[!tails_ticket 12679 desc="sandboxing Tor Browser's content renderer processes more strictly with AppArmor"]].
We now have a working draft and are waiting for our
[pull request](https://github.com/micahflee/torbrowser-launcher/pull/280)
to be merged upstream.

We started fixing regressions introduced in Tails 3.0, such as
[[!tails_ticket 12481 desc="SSH_AUTH_SOCK occasionally not being set in GNOME Terminal"]]
and
[[!tails_ticket 12696 desc="Tails Installer rejects working USB drives, pretending they're not removable"]].
Our Help Desk and Foundation Team met and prioritized the remaining ones
from a user-centric point of view.

## Reproducible Builds

We are still working on making Tails ISO images build reproducibly.
We've seen some images build in such a deterministic manner in March and 
even during a testing session. However, in some build environments it
does not work reliably yet and some new issues have manifested
themselves which need to be fixed until we can claim that our ISO 
images are really reproducible, such as
[[!tails_ticket 12641 desc="Comment changes in POT files make ISO non reproducible"]].
Besides, we need to draw a line wrt. what kind of build environment
variations we want to support.

Furthermore, we are still working on documenting the new release process and 
verification options for our users
([[!tails_ticket 12616]], [[!tails_ticket 12629]], [[!tails_ticket 12630]]).

User experience
===============

- We discussed strategies to [porting our Download and Verify extension
  for Firefox to *Web
  Extensions*](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-ux/2017-June/003394.html),
  a requirement for the upcoming Firefox 57 (November 14), as this will
  affect the design of our download instructions.

- We finished the redesign of *Tails Installer* to get rid of the
  initial splash screen. ([[!tails_ticket 8859]])

- We installed a [prototype of
  *Piwik*](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-ux/2017-June/003398.html),
  a free web analytics platform, to evaluate how well it would work
  against our privacy constraints and metrics needs.

- We agreed on increasing the size of the system partition from 2.5 to 4
  GiB minimum starting from Tails 3.2 (October 3) to allow for more
  automatic upgrades before a manual upgrade is needed. ([[!tails_ticket
  12705]])

Infrastructure
==============

## Improving communication & transparency wrt. our core teams' priorities

We have
[set up](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-project/2017-June/000873.html)
some infrastructure bits so that all contributors have more visibility
and power over our core teams's priorities.

## HTTPS mirror pool

We've switched our mirror pool to mirrors serving files over HTTPS
only ([[!tails_ticket 12837]]). Our round-robin fallback DNS
pool is still serving files over HTTP, and we are currently thinking
about how to switch those to HTTPS too ([[!tails_ticket 12833]]).

## Reproducible builds

Remaining issues on our CI infrastructure include:

* [[!tails_ticket 12618 desc="Retrieving ISO build artifacts sometimes fails on Jenkins"]]
* [[!tails_ticket 13302 desc="/var/lib/libvirt/images sometimes gets filled on isobuilders, take 2"]]
* [[!tails_ticket 12595 desc="Not enough space in /var/lib/jenkins on isobuilders"]]
* [[!tails_ticket 12681 desc="reproducibly_build_Tails_ISO_* Jenkins jobs are buggy when building from a tag"]]

## Sysadmin

We [[!tails_ticket 13232 desc="kept our systems up and running"]],
which was not always easy since we've deployed our updated
infrastructure for reproducible builds before upgrading our capacity
accordingly, not mentioning a kernel regression caused by the initial
*Stack Clash* fix that broke our CI.

We deployed [[!tails_ticket 11523 desc="some"]]
[[!tails_ticket 5894 desc="work"]] done by groente, who is in the
process of joining our sysadmin team.

## tails-support mailing list

We closed the [[`tails-support@boum.org` mailing
list|news/closing_tails-support]].

Funding
=======

- We've created a page listing our partners, previous and current [[grants, private companies and individuals who help keep Tails alive|partners]] by supporting us financially. [[Do you want to partner with us too?|partners/become]]

- We are making good progress on our proposal with OTF, and we hope
  we'll be able to share great news soon :)

- We kept working on migrating our European fiscal sponsor from Zwiebelfreunde
  to [CCT, the Center for the Cultivation of Technology](https://techcultivation.org/).

- We have bootstrapped a process to do our budget forecasting for next year.
