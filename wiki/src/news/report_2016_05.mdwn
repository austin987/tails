Code
====

- segfault sent his
  [first](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2016-May/010637.html) and
  [second](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2016-May/010663.html)
  report on his GSoC on *Tails Server*.

- We've prepared a patched version of Icedove and Torbirdy for
  the next Tails release. Icedove users can now use the automatic
  configuration wizard and by default, requests will be done only
  over secure protocols.
  Other Icedove improvements include using a hkps keyserver in Enigmail,
  default to POP if persistence is enabled, IMAP if not. We've disabled remote
  email account creation. All our patches are being upstreamed to Thunderbird
  and Torbirdy.


Documentation and website
=========================

- sajolida finished replacing the old installation instructions we had before
  the installation assistant. This implied rewriting our instructions for
  OpenPGP verification which now include a direct
  download link. We are [[!tails_ticket 11024 desc="still discussing"]] how to
  better link this page to make it easier to find.

- emmapeel documented how to [[exchange files with I2P
  Browser|doc/anonymous_internet/i2p#index2h1]].

- sajolida sent some [statistics on the hits on our
  website](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-project/2016-May/000508.html).

User experience
===============

- We discussed the design of [segfault's second prototype for *Tails
  Server*](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-ux/2016-May/000953.html).

- We discussed the design of the [**Unlock** and **Relock** widgets of the
  new *Tails Greeter*](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-ux/2016-May/000952.html).

- kurono wrote a [simplified interface for *Tails
  Installer*](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-ux/2016-May/000990.html)
  that would allow removing the splash screen and asked for reviews of
  his design.

Infrastructure
==============

- Our channel #tails for user support moved from IRC to [[XMPP|xmpp://tails@conference.riseup.net]]. For further details read our [[support page|support]].

- The new mirror pool is now used by Tails Upgrader, by users who download Tails without using our Download And Verification Extension for Firefox (aka. DAVE), for any download that is not supported by DAVE (e.g. release candidates), and for downloads started from a web browser that has JavaScript disabled. So, in summary two of the use cases of this work are covered already, and only the "downloading with DAVE" use case is left to complete. As of May 31st we now have 36 active mirrors.

Funding
=======

- [Mediapart](https://www.mediapart.fr/), a French online investigative journal
  that uses Tails for their work, is the first media organization to answer
  positively our call to support Tails financially. The terms of our
  partnership are still being discussed.

- We submitted a proposal to fund reproducible builds to the [Mozilla Open
  Source Support](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2016/05/11/mozilla-open-source-support-moss-now-open-to-all-projects/).

Outreach
========

Upcoming events
---------------

- jvoisin and fr33tux are going to give a talk on Tails at [Nuit du Hack](https://www.nuitduhack.com/en/talks.html#tails)
