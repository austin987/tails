# Known issues

- Tails may fail to start on some computers with Intel graphical
  hardware: a regression in the i915 Linux kernel module can lead
  to a black screen when trying to boot this Tails version
  ([[!tails_ticket 16224]], [[!debbug 914980]]). Users may want
  to delay upgrading until a solution has been identified.

See the list of [[long-standing issues|support/known_issues]].
