"A bunch of people spend a dozen days together in July at the third Tails "
"developers yearly summit. This was a great opportunity to have crazy hacking "
"sessions in person, as well as to discuss where we are heading to and how."

"We mainly discussed the **growth of the project**: given the growing number "
"of users and our super-short release cycle, it is a challenge to keep the "
"project sustainable and maintainable in the mid/long term."

"Our take on this is first reflected by [[!tails_roadmap desc=\"our\n"
"**updated roadmap**\"]]: we now have a better vision of what we want to\n"
"focus on for the next major releases of Tails: the 1.0, 1.1 and 2.0\n"
"milestones are now pretty well defined, and we even were bold enough\n"
"to draft goals for 3.0.\n"

"Another key aspect on this topic was that we need to **make it easier to "
"contribute** to Tails. We have listed many enhancements that could be made "
"in this direction, especially [on the website](https://labs.riseup.net/code/"
"projects/tails/issues?query_id=115).  We also have identified areas that "
"could benefit most from a few new dedicated contributors. We will publish "
"targeted calls for help in the next few months."

"We also **redesigned our communication channels** to ease involvement of new "
"contributors, to make more workload sharing possible, and to be able to "

"Our mailing lists see quite a lot of traffic these days.  This might deter "
"people from reading it. So, we will create two specialized mailing lists: a "
"private, encrypted one will receive bug reports, while a public one will be "
"dedicated to user support."

"A growing FAQ will be assembled: it will be a tool for self-service help, "

"To end with, the **public development meetings** experiment will be "
"extended, and we will go on having monthly **Low Hanging Fruits sessions**. "
"Not only these sessions are very useful to make Tails better, but we were "
"happy to see new people join these parties recently. We hope to see even "
"more of that in the future: these sessions are great times to **start "

"Hours of meetings were certainly a necessary part of the summit, but we also "

"The most noticeable technical change that happened during the summit was "
"perhaps [our **move to Redmine**](https://labs.riseup.net/code/projects/"
"tails) for managing our [tasks](https://labs.riseup.net/code/projects/tails/"
"issues?query_id=108)  and [[!tails_roadmap desc=\"plans\"]]. We are not "
"exploiting the full potential of Redmine yet, but it already feels far less "
"messy than how we did previously. Hopefully this will help others get "
"involved! Many thanks go to Riseup for hosting the Redmine instance we use.  "
"Note that we will keep using ikiwiki for [[blueprints|blueprint]]."

"Taking advantage of Redmine, we have started classifying tasks in various "
"useful ways: e.g. [**easy tickets**](https://labs.riseup.net/code/projects/"
"tails/issues?query_id=112)  do not require much knowledge of the Tails "
"internals to be solved, and are ideal places to get involved. In passing, "
"other nice custom queries provide lists of tasks involving [sysadmin]"
"(https://labs.riseup.net/code/projects/tails/issues?query_id=113)  and [web "
"development](https://labs.riseup.net/code/projects/tails/issues?"
