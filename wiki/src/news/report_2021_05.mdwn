Highlights of the month
=======================

## Improving the experience of connecting to Tor

In May, the coders' main focus were on improving the experience of
connecting to Tor in Tails, which we first showed off in [[Tails
4.19~beta1|test_4.19-beta1]] and later with some improvements in
[[Tails 4.19~rc1|test_4.19-rc1]]. We had initially planned to include
this new work in 4.19 but we decided at the last minute to postpone
it: we did not feel confident enough that the whole thing was robust
enough to unleash it onto our users. Our current plan is to have this
work released in Tails 4.20 on July 13.

One aspect of this work that may be interesting for some of you is
that we defined for guidelines for non-user-initiated non-Tor Internet
activity in Tails. We haven't implemented any such activity yet, but
we plan to do so in the next few months, in particular to detect
captive portals and test bridge reachability. If you're curious,

## Prevent future automatic upgrade issues

We grew tired of breaking automatic upgrades every few months due to
changes in how Let's Encrypt certificates are signed, which we clearly
are not managing to predict, and adjust to, before it harms our
users. So for now, [[!tails_ticket desc="we disabled CA pinning for
Tails Upgrader" 18324]].
