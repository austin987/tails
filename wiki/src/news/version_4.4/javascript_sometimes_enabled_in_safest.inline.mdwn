Tor is aware of a technical issue that allows JavaScript execution in
the *Safest* [[security level of *Tor Browser*|doc/anonymous_internet/Tor_Browser#security_level]]
in some situations.

Until then, do the following to completely disable JavaScript instead of
setting the security level:

1. Open the address <span class="command">about:config</span> in *Tor
   Browser*.

   [[!img news/version_3.13.2/about-config.png link="no"]]

1. Click the **I accept the risk!** button.

1. At the top of the page, search for
   <span class="command">javascript.enabled</span>.

1. Double-click on the **javascript.enabled** line in the
   results to set its value to **false**.
