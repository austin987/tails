The following changes were introduced in Tails 4.4:

  Tails 4.5~rc1 should start on computers in UEFI mode and with Secure
  Boot enabled.

Code
====

- Secure Boot support was merged ([[!tails_ticket 6560]]).

- Our test suite does not require Sikuli anymore ([[!tails_ticket
  15460]]), which allows running it on recent Debian systems.

- We prepared for upgrading *po4a* ([[!tails_ticket 17005]]),
  which on the long term will lower translators' workfload.

Documentation and website
=========================

- Replaced Stefano Zacchiroli's key, which was expired, by Chris Lamb's
  key in our [[installation instructions from Debian using the command
  line and GnuPG|install/expert/usb]]. ([[!tails_ticket 17524]])

- Agreed on the renaming of some core features:

  - *Persistent Storage* ([[!tails_ticket 8948]])

  - *Welcome Screen* ([[!tails_ticket 15122]])

User experience
===============

- Did a lot of progress on the design of the new Home and About pages:

  - Finalized the texts of both pages.

  - Finalized draft illustrations for both pages.

  - Did 2 rounds of usability tests: 1 on paper and 1 on screen.

  - Designed a replacement of our current sidebar to be on top.

  - Started coding responsive HTML and CSS using CSS Flexbox
