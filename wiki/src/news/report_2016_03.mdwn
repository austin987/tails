Releases
========

* [[Tails 2.2 was released on March 8|news/version_2.2]] (major release).

* [[Tails 2.2.1 was released on March 18|news/version_2.2.1]] (minor release).

* Tails 2.3 is [[scheduled for April 19|contribute/calendar]].

The following changes were introduced in 2.2:

- Add support for viewing DVDs with DRM protection. ([[!tails_ticket 7674]])

- Replace *Vidalia*, which has been unmaintained for years, with:
  - a system status icon indicating whether Tails is connected to Tor or not,
  - [[*Onion Circuits*|doc/anonymous_internet/tor_status]] to display a list of the current Tor circuits and connections.

- Automatically save the database of *KeePassX* after every change to prevent
  data loss when shutting down. ([[!tails_ticket 11147]])

- Disable the <span class="keycap">Alt + Shift</span> and
  <span class="keycap">Left Shift + Right Shift</span> keyboard
  shortcuts that used to switch to the next keyboard layout.
  You can still use <span class="keycap">Meta + Space</span> to change
  keyboard layout. ([[!tails_ticket 11042]])

- Fix **optional PGP key** feature of *WhisperBack*. ([[!tails_ticket 11033]])

- Fix saving of *WhisperBack* report to a file when offline. ([[!tails_ticket 11133]])

- Make Git verify the integrity of transferred objects. ([[!tails_ticket 11107]])

Code
====

* segfault applied for a Google Summer of Code on [[Tails
  Server|blueprint/server_edition]]. Their goal is to make it easy to run
  onion services from inside Tails (web servers, chat servers, tools for
  collaborative edition, etc.).

* We finished a [[script that allows running a Mumble, a VoIP
  server|blueprint/mumble-server]] from Tails on an onion service. We are
  now discussing how and whether this should be integrated in Tails by
  default. ([[!tails_ticket 11241]])

* [Llama Tail](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2016-March/010468.html)
  and
  [GoodCrypto](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2016-March/010540.html)
  started porting our [[shell scripts to
  Python|blueprint/Port_shell_scripts_to_Python]].

* We decided to [drop our custom Ciphers and MACs settings for
  SSH](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2016-March/010446.html).

* u submitted some [patches for TorBirdy](https://github.com/ioerror/torbirdy/pull/30)
  to better support our improvements to the Thunderbird
  autoconfiguration assistant.

Documentation and website
=========================

* Many advanced users complained about the lack of a direct download link in
  our new installation assistant. We are working on adding one back while still
  protecting people from being lazy and skipping the ISO verification.
  ([[!tails_ticket 11024]])

* We worked on speeding up the build of the website and almost reached
  our goal of 30%. ([[!tails_ticket 11151]])

* We created a page that lists [[all our mailing lists and email
  addresses|about/contact]], their scope and policy.

* We improved the instructions for [[resetting a USB
  stick|doc/first_steps/reset/mac]] and verifying the ISO
  image in Mac OS X.

* We explained [[how to restart GNOME
  Shell|support/known_issues#restart-shell]]. This is particularly
  useful when icons and information located on the top right corner of
  the screen disappear.

User experience
===============

* sajolida sent the slides, mockups, and notes from his [UX session on
  connecting to Tor in Tails](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-ux/2016-March/000903.html)
  held at the Internet Freedom Festival.

Infrastructure
==============

* intrigeri and Cyril Brulebois [presented their design for our upcoming
  freezable APT repository](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2016-March/010369.html).
  It will allow saving snapshots of all the packages that are used to
  build a given Tails. It's a necessary step to have reproducible builds
  and allow distributing better the source code of all the software in
  Tails.

* anonym started [[using Dogtail|contribute/reports/SponsorS/2015/2016_03#index3h2]]
  to identify graphical user interface elements programmatically in our
  test suite, instead of based on screenshots.

* bertagaz deployed an Icinga2 monitoring system to monitor our most
  important services.

* We decided to drop the requirement for [OpenPGP communication with HTTP
  mirror operators](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2016-March/010376.html).

* We clarified what needs to be done to have a proper
  [[!tails_ticket 10331#note-14 desc="review"]] and
  [merge](https://labs.riseup.net/code/attachments/download/1294/weblate.svg)
  process in Weblate.

* 839 ISO images were automatically built and tested by our continuous integration infrastructure.
