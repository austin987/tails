Releases
========

[[Tails 2.5|news/version_2.5]] was released on August 2. It includes
a number of fixes for bugs and security holes.
   
Code
====

- We updated our roadmap, listing our [[priorities for the next
  years|contribute/roadmap]].

- Use a dedicated homepage for *Tor Browser* in Tails to be able to
  customize what we are showing when people start Tails ([[!tails_ticket 11725]]).

- We enabled [[!wikipedia address space layout randomization]] in the Linux
  kernel (`kASLR`) to improve protection from buffer overflow attacks.

- We installed [[`rngd`|contribute/design/random#rngd]] to improve the
  entropy of the random numbers generated on computers that have
  a hardware random number generator.

- Upgrade to Linux 4.6. This should improve the support for newer
  hardware (graphics, Wi-Fi, etc.)

- Improved the automatic configuration of *Icedove* for some use cases
  ([[!tails_ticket 11536]]), and started writing automated tests for
  *Icedove*.

- We've successfully provided an AppArmor profile to Debian's Icedove
  package and started integrating it into Tails ([[!tails_ticket 10750]]).

* We started porting Tails to Debian 9 (Stretch).

Documentation and website
=========================

- We documented how to [[install *Tails Installer* in Ubuntu
  16.04|install/debian/usb#ubuntu]] ([[!tails_ticket 11570]]).
  Unfortunately, this has to be done on the command line since *Tails
  Installer* is not listed in the new *Ubuntu Software* yet. But we are
  working on fixing this ([[!tails_ticket 11569]]).

Infrastructure
==============

* 658 ISO images were automatically built and tested by our continuous integration infrastructure.
* We started porting Tails to Debian 9 (Stretch). Adjusting our test
  suite to make it able to provide feedback about our early Tails 3.0
  ISO images is a critical part of this project. To do so, in the past
  we had to go through a tedious process of updating the dozens of
  pictures that we ask Sikuli to recognize; but this time, thanks to
  the work we [[!tails_ticket 10721 desc="recently did"]] to support
  Dogtail in our test suite, we are able to _remove_ many such
  pictures, and replace them with higher-level means of interacting
  with graphical user interfaces. So far we could remove 31 such
  images. This change brings two major benefits: it makes our test
  suite more robust, and it makes our project more sustainable, by
  decreasing the cost of porting Tails to future versions of Debian.
* Until recently, the parts of our test suite that rely on emulated
  USB storage devices were fragile on our Jenkins setup.
  This prevented us from running a number of tests there, e.g.
  those involving persistence. We kept working on it, as reported last
  month, both [[!tails_ticket 11590 desc="in Tails Installer itself"]]
  and in our test suite ([[!tails_ticket 11588]],
  [[!tails_ticket 11582]]). As a result, we were able to re-enable
  these tests on production branches in August.

On-going discussions
====================

See the
[[August 2016 online meeting minutes|contribute/meetings/201608]].

We've had a great Tails contributors summit, attended by almost
20 people.
