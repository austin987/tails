A security vulnerability was discovered in the sandboxing
mechanism of *Firefox* and *Tor Browser*. This vulnerability allows a
malicious website to bypass some of the confinement built in *Firefox*,
which means possibly spying on the content of other tabs and steal
the passwords of other websites.

After *Tor Browser* has been compromised, the only reliable solution is
to restart Tails.

Because *Tor Browser* in Tails is [[confined using
*AppArmor*|doc/anonymous_internet/Tor_Browser#confinement]], only the
data accessible to *Tor Browser* might be compromised but not the other
applications or your other files. For example, a compromised *Tor
Browser* might access your files in the *Tor Browser* and
*Persistent/Tor Browser* folders but not anywhere else.

For example, without restarting Tails:

- It is unsafe to:

  - Log in to a website and also visit an untrusted website.
    Your password on the first website might be stolen by the untrusted website.

  - Visit an untrusted website if you have sensitive information stored
    in your *Persistent/Tor Browser* folder. The untrusted website might
    access these files.

- It is safe to:

  - Visit untrusted websites, without logging in, if you have no
    sensitive information stored in your *Tor Browser* and
    *Persistent/Tor Browser* folders.

  - Log in to several trusted websites without visiting any untrusted
    websites.
