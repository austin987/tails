"It's no surprise that over the last years, the number of people who use "

"32-bit computers are at least ten years old, and one after the other their "

"**We want Tails users to be safer**: software built for 64-bit processors "

"**We want to our project to be (more) sustainable**: Tails has been using a "
"64-bit Linux kernel for a while on machines that support it.  But all other "
"programs included in Tails so far were built for 32-bit processors, and "
"compatibility issues kept arising. In the last few years, the developers who "
"maintain Tails have spent lots of time addressing such issues. We would "
"rather see them spend their time in ways that benefit our users on the long "
