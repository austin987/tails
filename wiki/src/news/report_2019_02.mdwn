Here is a summary of what happened in Tails land in February, 2019.

This month has seen the highest number of Tails boots per day ever:
27% more than a year ago! This is motivating: it confirms that Tails
is useful and relevant.

Releases
========

* [[Tails 3.12.1 was released on February 13|news/version_3.12.1]].
  A [critical vulnerability](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2019-05/)
  in the *Skia* library, used by *Firefox* and *Chrome* to render graphics,
  prompted this emergency release.

* Tails 3.13 is [[scheduled for March 19|contribute/calendar]].

Code
====

- We have coordinated with the _Tor Browser_ team wrt. the scope and
  timeline of upcoming big changes that will impact our work.

- We have implemented a potential fix and a mitigation measure for
  a longstanding bug: `persistence.conf` sometimes becomes empty.
  [[!tails_ticket 10976]], [[!tails_ticket 16461]]

- We have prepared a number of updates for Tails 3.13:
  - Debian Stretch 9.8 ([[!tails_ticket 16462]]), merged
  - Linux 4.19.20 ([[!tails_ticket 16458]]), merged
  - Tor 0.3.5 ([[!tails_ticket 16348]]), in progress

- We released new versions of the verification extension to fix usability
  and security issues:

  - Download page is not refreshed when verification extension is
    installed ([[!tails_ticket #16078]])
  - Verification extension should not be detectable as per Sjösten, and
    al. ([[!tails_ticket 14787]])
  - Updated to Forge 0.8.0.


Documentation and website

  ([[!tails_ticket 15599]]).

- We contracted visual artists to work on a video to explain how to start Tails
  (and use the boot menu key). ([[!tails_ticket 10649]])

- We analyzed why some people are wiping their persistence while
  upgrading with USB images. ([[!tails_ticket 16470]])

- We investigated outgoing network connections initiated by
  _Etcher_ and researched how to solve the privacy concerns
  we have with them. [[!tails_ticket 16381]]

Hot topics on our help desk
===========================



1. Electrum users are complaining about the fact that it may need to be upgraded. ([[!tails_ticket 16421]])

  [[!tails_ticket 15501]]

  we've switched to the puppetlabs/mysql module. [[!tails_ticket 15513]]
