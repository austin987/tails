Outreach

  held](http://www.irill.org/events/tails-confidentialite-et-anonymat-pour-tous-et-partout)
  in Paris. Thanks to Stefano Zacchiroli for organizing it, and to
  IRILL for hosting it!

Funding
=======

- We have sent proposals to sponsors Echo and Hotel.
- We have been approached for a funding proposal by sponsor Golf.
- We read a lot and got in touch with various people to gather enough
  information to decide if we're going to create a dedicated
  non-profit organization for Tails, or use another existing one as
  our fiscal sponsor.

Press and testimonials
======================

* 2013-10-15: [CRYPTO-GRAM, October 15,
  2013](http://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram-1310.html) —
  Bruce Schneier: "One thing I didn't do, although it's worth considering, is
  use a stateless operating system like Tails. You can configure Tails with a
  persistent volume to save your data, but no operating system changes are ever
  saved. Booting Tails from a read-only DVD -- you can keep your data on an
  encrypted USB stick -- is even more secure. Of course, this is not foolproof,
  but it greatly reduces the potential avenues for attack."
