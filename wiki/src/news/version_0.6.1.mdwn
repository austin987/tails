The Amnesic Incognito Live System, version 0.6.1, is out.

This is a bugfix-only release mainly aimed at fixing serious security
issues in bundled software. All users must upgrade as soon as
possible.

Notable changes include:

- Tor 0.2.1.28: resolves possible remote code execution, see the [Tor
  project blog
  post](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-02128-released-security-patches)
  for details.
- Other software upgrades fix grave bugs, most of these with serious
  security implications.
- FireGPG and Seahorse: use the keyserver configured in `gpg.conf`.
- HTP: display the logs when the clock synchronization fails.
- Use the light version of the "Are you using Tor?" webpage.
