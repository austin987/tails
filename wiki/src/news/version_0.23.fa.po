"* Major new features\n"
"  - [[Spoof the network interfaces' MAC "
"address|doc/first_steps/startup_options/mac_spoofing]]\n"
"    by default. It can be disabled in Tails Greeter.\n"
"  - Rework the way to\n"
"    [[configure how Tor connects to the "
"network|doc/first_steps/startup_options/network_configuration]]\n"
"    by using bridges, proxies and restrictive firewalls. This option\n"
"    can be set from Tails Greeter, and replaces the old\n"
"    experimental \"bridge mode\" feature.\n"

"* Bugfixes\n"
"  - Additional software: do not crash when persistence is disabled.\n"
"  - Upgrade Pidgin to 2.10.9, that fixes some regressions introduced\n"
"    in the 2.10.8 security update.\n"
"  - Wait for Tor to have fully bootstrapped, plus a bit more time,\n"
"    before checking for upgrades and unfixed known security issues.\n"
"  - Disable the Intel Management Engine Interface driver. We don't\n"
"    need it in Tails, it might be dangerous, and it causes bugs on\n"
"    various hardware such as systems that reboot when asked to shut\n"
"    down.\n"
"  - Add a launcher for the Tails documentation. This makes it\n"
"    available in Windows Camouflage mode.\n"
"  - Remove the obsolete wikileaks.de account from Pidgin.\n"

"* Minor improvements\n"
"  - Upgrade Tor to 0.2.4.21-1~d60.squeeze+1.\n"
"  - Upgrade obfsproxy to 0.2.6-2~~squeeze+1.\n"
"  - Upgrade I2P to 0.9.11-1deb6u1.\n"
"  - Install 64-bit kernel instead of the 686-pae one. This is a\n"
"    necessary first step towards UEFI boot support.\n"
"  - Install Monkeysign (in a not-so-functional shape yet).\n"
"  - Disable the autologin text consoles. This was one of the blockers\n"
"    before a screen saver can be installed in a meaningful way.\n"
"  - Don't localize the text consoles anymore: it is broken on Wheezy,\n"
"    the intended users can as well use loadkeys, and we now do not\n"
"    have to trust setupcon to be safe for being run as root by the\n"
"    desktop user.\n"
"  - Make it possible to manually start IBus.\n"
"  - Reintroduce the possibility to switch identities in the Tor\n"
"    Browser, using a filtering proxy in front of the Tor ControlPort\n"
"    to avoid giving full control over Tor to the desktop user.\n"
"  - Incremental upgrades improvements:\n"
"    * Drop the Tails Upgrader launcher, to limit users' confusion.\n"
"    * Lock down sudo credentials a bit.\n"
"    * Hide debugging information.\n"
"    * Include ~/.xsession-errors in WhisperBack bug reports.\n"
"      This captures the Tails Upgrader errors and debugging information.\n"
"    * Report more precisely why an incremental upgrade cannot be done.\n"
"    * Various user interface and phrasing improvements.\n"
"  - Don't install the Cookie Monster browser extension.\n"
"  - Add a browser bookmark pointing to Tor's Stack Exchange.\n"
"  - Remove the preconfigured #tor channel from the Pidgin: apparently,\n"
"    too many Tails users go ask Tails questions there, without making\n"
"    it clear that they are running Tails, hence creating a\n"
"    user-support nightmare.\n"
"  - Use (most of) Tor Browser's mozconfig.\n"
"  - Rebase the browser on top of iceweasel 24.3.0esr-1, to get the\n"
"    certificate authorities added by Debian back.\n"
"  - Give access to the relevant documentation pages from Tails Greeter.\n"
"  - Hide Tails Greeter's password mismatch warning when entry is changed.\n"
"  - Persistent Volume Assistant:\n"
"    * Take into account our installer is now called Tails Installer.\n"
"    * Optimize window height.\n"
"    * Display device paths in a more user-friendly way.\n"
