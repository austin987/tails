"Unlike most other tools on the Internet, Tails comes for *free* as in "
"*freedom*. We are not selling your data, sending you targeted advertising, "
"nor will ever sell our project to a big company. We give out Tails for free "
"simply because everybody deserves to be protected from surveillance and "
"censorship. But also because being free software is a necessary requirement "
"for our tools to be safe, and protect you as intended. If our source code "
"was closed, there would be no way of actually verifying that our software is "
"trustworthy."

"We often hear complaints about the fact that many software projects that are "
"meant to fight surveillance, like Tor and Tails, get a lot of funding from "
"the US government whose own surveillance projects are severely criticized. "
"We completely share this concern and we will worry about our accountability "
"and sustainability as long as the survival of our project depends on a few "
"small grants, some of them coming from organizations linked to governments."

"From [[anonymized statistics|support/faq#boot_statistics]] on our website we "
"know that Tails is used by around 18 000 people every day. **If each of them "
"gave 12€, the price of a USB stick, our budget for the whole year would be "
"raised within one day.** As you can see, funding Tails through donations is "
"a realistic and our budget ridiculously small compared to the "
"multibillionaire companies and agencies running the surveillance business."

"But many of our users could actually get in trouble if they donated to an "
