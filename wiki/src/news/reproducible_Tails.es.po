"We have received the Mozilla Open Source Support award in order to make "
"Tails ISO images build reproducibly. This project was on our roadmap for "
"2017 and with the release of Tails 3.3 we are proud to present one of the "
"world's first reproducible ISO images of a Linux operating system."

"When we write software, we do this using programming languages which a human "
"can read and understand. This is called the _source code_. One can imagine "
"source code much like a very precise recipe. Such a recipe describes an "
"exact procedure: which ingredients and which amount of ingredients do you "
"need? How should they be mixed together at which temperature should they be "
"cooked or baked? The recipe will even describe the expected outcome: how the "
"meal should look and taste like."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"When we generate a Tails ISO image, our source code and the Debian packages "
"we include are assembled into a binary ISO image, much like when the "
"ingredients of the recipe are mixed together, one obtains the meal. The "
"amounts and ingredients of this meal cannot be easily reverse "
"engineered. The result of *our* cooking process is a Tails ISO image which "
"users download and install onto a USB stick."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"We, chefs and aides in the kitchen (Tails developers and contributors), "
"provide you, our users, with several means to verify that this ISO image is "
"indeed the one we want you to download, either using our Firefox add-on "
"which does this verification automatically for you or by using our OpenPGP "
"signature. Both of these verification methods simply tell you that the ISO "
"image is the image which we want you to download: That the meal you get is "
"indeed the meal that you've ordered, and not a meal which has been poisoned "
"or exchanged by an evil waiter (such as a download mirror)."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"However, even with such sophisticated verification methods, it is still "
"impossible to trace back the meal to the recipe: Does the meal contain only "
"the ingredients it is supposed to contain? Or could unauthorized personnel "
"have broken into the kitchen at night, and then poisoned the ingredients and "
"made the oven cook at 50 degrees higher than displayed? In other words, "
"could a malicious entity have compromised our build machines? That's what "
"reproducible builds help verify and protect against."

"> Reproducible builds are a set of software development practices that "
"create\n"
"> a verifiable path from human readable source code to the binary code "
"used\n"
"> by computers. *(quoted from https://reproducible-builds.org/)*\n"
msgstr ""

"In other words, with reproducible builds, each cooking process of the same "
"recipe is exactly repeatable."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"At Tails, we have worked during a year to implement such a set of "
"practices. This makes it now possible to compare ISO images built by "
"multiple parties from the same source code and Debian packages, and to "
"ensure that they all result in exactly the same ISO image."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"Or again, using our cooking metaphor: Several of us will cook the meal, "
"compare that we all cooked the same meal and only once we're sure about "
"that, we will deliver it to you."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"We all can thus gain confidence that no broken oven has introduced malicious "
"code or failures: or we would notice it before delivering the meal."

"This does not change anything in the way you download and install Tails, and "
"you don't have to make additional verifications. It simply helps trust that "
"the Tails ISO image that we distribute is indeed coming from the source code "
"and Debian packages it is meant to be made of.  With reproducible Tails, it "
"only takes one knowledgeable person to build Tails and compare with the ISO "
"image the Tails project distributes to uncover some kinds of backdoors."

"And by the way, not only our ISO images are now reproducible, but so are our "
