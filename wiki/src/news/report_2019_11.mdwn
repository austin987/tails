Documentation and website
=========================

- We improved our explanation of the [[enhanced
  privacy|doc/anonymous_internet/thunderbird#torbirdy]] of *Thunderbird* in
  Tails. ([[!tails_ticket 17270]])

- We instructed people facing [[recurring errors when
  upgrading|doc/upgrade/error/check]] to do a manual upgrade.
  ([[!tails_ticket 12492]])

- We improved the layout of the [[manual upgrade
  documentation|doc/upgrade/#manual]]. ([[!tails_ticket 12492]])

User experience
===============

- We finished processing the feedback on our [[mission and
  values|contribute/mission]]. ([[!tails_ticket 16540]])

  Our work on this document was explained in [Open source & branding – a
  contradiction?](https://simplysecure.org/blog/branding-tails), by Simply
  Secure.

- Update *Etcher* to 1.5.61 to fix installing from macOS Catalina. ([[!tails_ticket 17185]])

Hot topics on our help desk
===========================

1. Multiple users reported having trouble [[!tails_ticket 17183 desc="importing keys in Seahorse"]].

1. We also had some reports about [[!tails_ticket 17184 desc="issues
   with Nvidia"]] [[!tails_ticket 17155 desc="graphics cards"]].

1. macOS users were affected by a [[!tails_ticket 17185 desc="bug in
   Etcher"]].

Infrastructure
==============

- We finished updating the list of members in our [[signing key
  revocation mechanism|doc/about/openpgp_keys/signing_key_revocation]]. ([[!tails_ticket 16665]])

  We lost 5 members and added 8 new members. So the resiliency of the
  scheme was increased overall. Thanks again to all the new members :)

Funding
=======

- Received a very generous donation of 6 bitcoins from
  [[PrivCoin|partners]].

- We blogged about [[our plans for 2020|news/plans_for_2020]].

- Our fundraising campaign is doing pretty well.

  Compared to the same period in 2017 and 2018 (first 41 days):

  <pre>
                 2016       2017        2018       2019
                 ----       ----        ----       ----
  Amount         54 925 €   54 873 €    28 854 €   48 710 €    69%
  Count            1124        717        1182       1084     -16%
  
  Final amount   76 055 €   101 644 €   74 480 €
  </pre>

  We are doing pretty good in terms of both amount and number of donations
  thought we're not set any record in either metrics.

  This is not due to the lack of counter this year because the first 2 weeks of
  this year were much worse than last year (when they was no counter yet) and
  weeks 3-5 were better (when we had a counter already).

  We cannot really explain these 16% less donations but it's not a big deal
  either.

Outreach
========

Past events
-----------

- [Damaris Mendoza](https://twitter.com/damriv) presented Tails to 20
  digital security trainers at the Encuentro Centroamericano de
  Seguridad Digital in Guatemala City.

On-going discussions
====================

- Technical writers sent a proposal to improve and simplify the terminology
  around "Persistence":

  <https://lists.autistici.org/message/20191108.153500.fbbf3592.en.html>

- We are discussing what kind of password strength meter we should have in the
  Persistence creation assistant. ([[!tails_ticket 7002]])

- We started discussion whether we should say "*freedom fighters*" or "*human-rights
  defenders*" in our mission and values:
