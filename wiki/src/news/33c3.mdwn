As part of our donation campaign we already explained you [[why we need
donations|news/why_we_need_donations]], [[what we do with your
money|news/what_we_do_with_your_money]], and that [[Mediapart is the
first news organization to commit to support Tails every
year|news/mediapart]].

But today we are just writing to give you all a big thank you!

**Since October 13, we have received $98 579 in donations.**

This is our first donation campaign and we are completely blown away by the
results! It feels really good to see that our community of users
understands the real value of Tails and why it is important for them to
help us back and keep the project alive and independent.

Starting from today we will be present at the [33rd Chaos Communication
Congress in Hamburg](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2016/wiki/Main_Page).
You are encouraged to pass by and meet us at the [Secure Desktops
assembly](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2016/wiki/Assembly:Secure_Desktops).

We accept donations in cash and people donating more than 50€ in Hamburg
will get a Tails t-shirt!
