Releases
========

* [[Tails 3.7.1 was released on June 10|news/version_3.7.1]] (emergency release).

* [[Tails 3.8 was released on June 26|news/version_3.8]] (minor release).

* Tails 3.9 is [[scheduled for September 5|contribute/calendar]].

The following changes were introduced in Tails 3.7.1:

- Upgrade *Tor Browser* to 7.5.5.

  This fixes a [[!mfsa 2018-14 desc="critical issue in Firefox"]]
  announced on June 6.

- Upgrade *Thunderbird* to 52.8.0.

  This partly mitigates the infamous EFAIL attack and fixes importing
  OpenPGP keys from keyservers with Enigmail.

- Fix setting a screen locker password with non-ASCII characters.
  ([[!tails_ticket 15636]])

- Rename the *WhisperBack* launcher to "WhisperBack Error Reporting"
  so that users have a better chance to understand what it does.
  ([[!tails_ticket 6432]])

The following changes were introduced in Tails 3.8:

- Upgrade *Enigmail* from 1.9.9 to
  [2.0.7](https://enigmail.net/index.php/en/download/changelog#enig2.0.7) which
  fixes some of the [EFAIL](https://efail.de/) attacks on OpenPGP.

- Fix importing OpenPGP keys from email attachments. ([[!tails_ticket 15610]])

- Fix the translations of the homepage of the *Unsafe Browser*. ([[!tails_ticket 15461]])


Code
====

- We have worked on improving support for recent graphics cards and in
  particular those produced by Nvidia. We've sent
  a [call for testing](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-testers/2018-June/001018.html)
  and
  [updated](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-testers/2018-June/001029.html)
  it. If the feedback is good, we will probably include these changes
  in Tails 3.9.

- We have kept working on fixing the EFAIL attacks against
  encrypted email ([[!tails_ticket 15602]]). Tails 3.8 fixed most of
  them and Tails 3.9 should fix the remaining ones.

- We have worked on detecting earlier changes that would break
  automatic upgrades ([[!tails_ticket 15419]])… and already identified
  one we need to fix in time for Tails 3.9 ([[!tails_ticket 15695]]).

- Chris Lamb prepared a fix for the most infamous rendering issue (raw PO
  content being inserted in some page) that affects our website
  ([[!tails_ticket 6907]]).

User experience
===============

- We conducted a [moderated user testing of the VeraCrypt
  feature](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-ux/2018-June/003554.html).


Hot topics on our help desk
===========================

1. Surface Pro users reported having trouble with wireless ([[!tails_ticket 15520]]).

1. We still receive emails from several users displayed with the message
   pointing to <https://tails.boum.org/gdm>.
