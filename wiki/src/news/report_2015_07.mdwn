July started frenetically, with the postponed release on the 3rd. Then we had a Tails contributors meeting, and it was lots of fun and hard work. We decided broad directions for the incoming years, that you'll see in our [[draft roadmap for 2016-2017|blueprint/roadmap_2016-2017]]. We also reevaluated our processes and tools, and had a dance party. Tails contributors are ready to go on doing amazing work :)

Documentation and website
=========================

* We documented how to [[reset a USB stick or SD card using Mac OS X|doc/reset/mac]].

* [[FAQ: Should I manually update add-ons included in Tor Browser?|support/faq#add-ons_update]]

* Adapted the documentation because [[the LAN is now only accessible from the Unsafe Browser|doc/advanced_topics/lan]].

User experience
===============

* We rediscussed the terminology around installation media and decided
  to only advertise SD cards as a corner case.

* Clarified the thread model of the automatic ISO verification extension
  regarding [[attacks inside the browser|blueprint/bootstrapping/extension#inside_the_browser]].

* There was some [work on the Greeter](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-ux/2015-July/000507.html)

Infrastructure
==============

* Our test suite covers 185 scenarios, 3 more that in April.

* All active development branches [[!tails_ticket 5324 desc="are now
  built"]] automatically with Jenkins. This is the first stage towards
  integrating our automated test suite at the core of our software
  development process, and to run it continuously on our development
  versions while they are being developed.

* We started a discussion about having a [[CRM to handle our user support requests|blueprint/CRM_for_frontdesk]].

* We made progess on the [automated tests
  specification](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2015-July/009160.html),
  and started working on the corresponding underlying infrastructure,
  starting with extending the storage capacity on our main server and
  creating a bunch of new virtual machines.

* We are almost done [[!tails_ticket 9262 desc="porting our ISO build
  system to Debian Jessie"]].
