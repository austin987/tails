The following changes were introduced in Tails 3.5:

  synchronization changed the clock in the past. ([[!tails_ticket 14250]])

  non-English languages. ([[!tails_ticket 15160]])

  notifications. ([[!tails_ticket 13437]])

  *Thunderbird* to start in some cases. ([[!tails_ticket 12734]])

User experience
===============

### Interviews of Tails users

We published 4 new interviews:

- 2 from people attending 34C4: [[Daan|blueprint/interviews#Daan]] and
  [[Charles|blueprint/interviews#Charles]].

- 4 from journalists from Latin America: [[Joana & Orlando|blueprint/interviews#Joana]] and
  [[Claudia & Felix|blueprint/interviews#Claudia]].

### Additional Software

We designed the interactions and interfaces for people to install
additional software every time Tails is started.

Like for [[our work on VeraCrypt in
December|contribute/reports/SponsorW/2017_12#sprint]], we did that
through paper prototyping and formative testing with users in Berlin.

Here are the most visible parts of this upcoming feature.

Hot topics on our help desk
===========================

<a id="electrum"></a>

1. *Electrum* users were very stressed about [vulnerability found in Electrum
in January](https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/issues/3374). Tails is not
affected as [[!tails_ticket 15151 desc="our firewall blocks the connections
required to exploit this vulnerability"]]. Still, we will update *Electrum* in
Tails 3.6.

1. Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities made our users restless.

1.  [[!tails_ticket 15254 desc="Tails Installer breaks in locales other
than the default"]] was a hard one, although on the other side we see
again that many people use Tails in another language than English.

1.  [[!tails_ticket 15116 desc="NVidia Maxwell and Pascal graphic cards
are still giving problems in Tails 3.5."]]

1. As every time we update the Tails signing key, many users got scared by
the gpg messages received during OpenGPG ISO verification, but there are
several tickets open about this [[!tails_ticket 14711]], [[!tails_ticket
13634]],  [[!tails_ticket 14977]].

Strategic planning
==================

We published [[notes on strategic planning
sessions|blueprint/strategic_planning]] that we had in August to
organize future discussions.

Infrastructure
==============

- We made plans to finish [[migrating all our download mirrors to
  HTTPS|blueprint/HTTP_mirror_pool#HTTPS]].

- We updated almost all the Puppet modules we use. ([[!tails_ticket 15154]])

- We started working on migrating our infrastructure to Puppet 4.
  ([[!tails_ticket 11834]])
