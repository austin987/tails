In 2019, we are especially proud of celebrating with you the 10 years of
Tails.

The first release of Tails, back then *amnesia*, was announced in 2009.
Since then we released 98 versions of Tails, which were used more than
40 million times.

Here are some stories about how it all started and some vintage
screenshots. But first of all, the birthday cake!

2009&ndash;2010: amnesia, T(A)ILS, and their ancestors
======================================================

Today, Tails is based on Debian, Tor, and GNOME. We inherit from their
work and try to contribute back in order to create a healthy ecosystem
of reliable, secure, and usable tools.

When we started the *amnesia* project back in 2009, other projects
before us paved the way to what is Tails today:

- [Knoppix](http://www.knoppix.org/), born in 2000 and still alive
  today, was the first popular live Linux distribution. Back then, it
  was a groundbreaking achievement to be able to start and use Linux
  without going through lengthy, very complex, and uncertain Linux
  install "parties". Knoppix was primarily designed for convenience and
  diagnosis.


- [ELE](https://web.archive.org/web/20050422130010/http://www.northernsecurity.net:80/download/ele/), born in 2005 and based on Damn Small Linux,
  [Anonym.OS](https://web.archive.org/web/20060212030338/http://theory.kaos.to:80/projects.html), born in 2006 and based on OpenBSD, and
  [Incognito](https://web.archive.org/web/20071213084719/http://www.browseanonymouslyanywhere.com/incognito/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=28&Itemid=41),
  born in 2007 and based on Gentoo, pushed the concept of live operating
  systems a bit further by focusing on security, online anonymity, and the use of Tor.

  *Incognito*
  was the first live operating system to include a full set of
  applications preconfigured to go through Tor (browser, email
  client, IRC client, etc.), offer a persistent *Home*
  directory, and even allow hosting onion services.
  *Incognito* was also the first live operating system to receive an
  [official recognition from the Tor
  Project](https://blog.torproject.org/incognito-and-tor-project-sign-licensing-agreement).

  The original author of *Incognito*, *Pat Double*, resigned in 2007 and *anonym*, who
  still works for Tails today, took over the maintenance.

- On August 16 2009, *intrigeri* announced the first release of
  *amnesia* on the [*tor-talk* mailing
  list](https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2009-August/002667.html).

- In March 2010, *Incognito* was declared dead and *amnesia* its
  "[spiritual
  successor](https://web.archive.org/web/20100728224716/http://www.anonymityanywhere.com:80/incognito)".
  Some weeks later, *amnesia* would be renamed *T(A)ILS*, *The Amnesic
  Incognito Live System*, to act the fusion between *amnesia* and
  *Incognito*.

  We quickly realized that having parenthesis in our name looked very
  radical but was quite confusing and finally settled on *Tails* in 2011.
  Eight years later, we still see most people on the Internet write it
  TAILS though it's never been written in all caps on our website.

  Hey people, it's Tails not TAILS!

This is how *amnesia* 0.2 and our website looked like in 2009. The
browser was *Iceweasel* with *Tor Button* and the Tor controller was
*TorK*.

2011-2014: core features, Tails 1.0, and public recognition
===========================================================

Until Tails 1.0 (April 2014), we would develop most of the core features
that make Tails today:

- **Tails Installer**, forked from the [[!wikipedia Fedora_Media_Writer
  desc="Fedora Live USB Creator"]]
- **Persistence**
- **Tails Greeter**, our welcome screen
- **Automatic upgades**
- **MAC Spoofing**
- **MAT (Metadata Anonymization Toolkit)**, which was developed by
  Julien Voisin as a Google Summer of Code with our help in 2011.

To support this intense development and the increased responsibility on
our shoulders, we accepted our first grant, from the *Swedish International
Development Agency* in 2011 and started paying for some of the
development work.

In October 2012, Tails was started around 2&#8239;500 times a day, 10
times less than today.

In June 2013, Edward Snowden would reveal thousands of classified
documents on the surveillance programs of the NSA. Tails got mentioned
by famous technologists [Bruce
Schneier](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/05/nsa-how-to-remain-secure-surveillance)
and [Micah
Lee](https://freedom.press/news/encryption-works-how-to-protect-your-privacy-and-your-sources-in-the-age-of-nsa-surveillance/)
as one of the tools that protect from the NSA surveillance.

In March 2014, we received our first award, the [Access Innovation Prize
for Endpoint
Security](https://www.accessnow.org/blog/2014/03/11/2014-access-innovation-prize-winners-announced-at-rightscon).
According to Access Now:

> Tails embodies the successful collaboration of developers, trainers,
> security professionals towards tackling the spectrum of user needs --
> from usability to security -- in high-risk environments.

The same month, we launched a [[logo contest|blueprint/logo]]. It was
heartwarming to receive 36 very creative proposals. Here are some of
the best ones:

[[!img logos.png link="no" alt=""]]

In April 2014, Freedom of the Press Foundation launched the first
crowdfunding campaign for Tails and revealed that Tails
"has been critical to all of the main NSA journalists". Since then,
[Edward Snowden](https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/975827513321623553)
and journalists [Laura
Poitras](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/10/7-privacy-tools-essential-making-citizenfour),
[Glenn
Greenwald](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/10/7-privacy-tools-essential-making-citizenfour),
and [Micah
Lee](https://theintercept.com/2014/10/28/smuggling-snowden-secrets/)
have repeatedly stated the importance of Tails for their work and
supported us in many ways.

<em>Images from <a href="https://citizenfourfilm.com/">Citizenfour</a> by Laura Poitras, minutes 37 and 41.</em>
</p>

A few weeks later, the release of Tails 1.0 got press coverage on
[The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2014/4/29/5664884/this-is-the-most-secure-computer-you-ll-ever-own),
[CNET](https://www.cnet.com/news/anonymous-os-reportedly-favored-by-nsa-whistle-blower-edward-snowden-reaches-version-1-0/),
[Boing Boing](https://boingboing.net/2014/04/30/tails-snowdens-favorite-ano.html),
and many others. In December, [Der Spiegel](https://www.spiegel.de/media/media-35535.pdf)
published internal NSA slides that categorize Tails as "catastrophic
impact" and "highest priority":

[[!img nsa.png link="https://www.spiegel.de/media/media-35535.pdf"
alt="Tor, TrueCrypt, Tails are classified as 'Use Risk: Current Highest
Priority Target Use' and 'Impact: Catastrophic (near-total loss/lack of
insight to target communications, presence)'"]]

This is how Tails 1.0 looked like in 2014. It had a camouflage mode that
looked like Windows XP and the Tor controller was *Vidalia*.

[[!img tails-1.0.png link="no" alt=""]]

2015-2019 - Maturity, user experience, and automation
=====================================================

In May 2014, the UX team at [NUMA
Paris](https://web.archive.org/web/20140524130455/http://events.numaparis.com/Evenements/Apero-Experience-Utilisateur-Tails-The-Amnesic-Incognito-Live-System)
invited us to organize a usability testing session of Tails with
journalists. We asked participants to do slightly complex tasks such as
establishing an encrypted conversation with someone else using *Pidgin*.
Reality hit us hard when all the journalists in the room encountered
problems to either install, start, or connect Tails to Tor. We realized
that, despite having laid down most of the core features in Tails 1.0,
we still had a lot of work to do to make Tails easy to use by most people.

Since then, we focused our work on 3 aspects of the project that don't
bring in so many new features but rather ensure its long term
sustainability and growth: user experience, continuous integration, and
project sustainability.

### User experience

Since these first usability tests in 2014, we systematically relied on
user-centered design practices to ensure that all the major changes that
we do in Tails are making it easier to use. We conducted 10 sessions of
usability tests, used [paper
prototypes](https://simplysecure.org/blog/formative-testing), conducted
[[quantitative surveys|blueprint/veracrypt]], and defined better our
audience using [[personas|contribute/personas]].

[[<img src="https://git.tails.boum.org/ux/plain/personas/personas-small.png" id="picture" class="img-responsive" alt="Our 3 personas: Riou, Cris, and Kim">|contribute/personas]]

This usability work was key in all the work that we did since 2015 to
make Tails easier to install:

- The [[installation instructions|install]] (2016)
- The [[verification extension|install/download]] (2016)
- The new [[Tails Greeter|news/version_3.0#greeter]] (2017)
- The shift to [[USB images and Etcher|news/version_3.12#usb-images]] (2019)

### Continuous integration

To cope with this rapid development and the many releases, we built a
cutting edge *continuous integration* infrastructure:

- Images of Tails are [built
  automatically](https://nightly.tails.boum.org/) every time we develop
  a change for an upcoming release.
- These images are [[tested
  automatically|contribute/release_process/test/automated_tests]]
  against a comprehensive list of usability and security scenarios.
- All our images are [[reproducible|news/reproducible_Tails]], which
  allows security researchers to verify that the images distributed on
  our website have not been modified to introduce undisclosed security
  vulnerabilities.

The following video shows the test suite in action. On the left, it
displays the scenario that is being tested, for example "*symmetrically
encrypting a message*". On the right, it displays Tails being
manipulated automatically according to the scenario.

<video controls="true" width="880" height="352">
  <source src="https://tails.boum.org/news/celebrating_10_years/test-suite.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

This infrastructure increases the quality and reliability of our
releases. It also makes it faster to publish emergency security releases
when important vulnerabilities are fixed, for example in Firefox and Tor
Browser.

### Project sustainability

The combination of these efforts both on visible improvements and behind
the scene had to go hand-in-hand with working on the sustainability of
the project as an organization.

Since 2014:

- The number of Tails users was multiplied by 2.4, increasing by 20%
  each year on average, reaching 25000 daily users on average in 2019.
  Our yearly budget was multiplied by a similar amount, to reach
  240&#8239;000€ (estimated) in 2019.
- We worked on foundational documents and processes to ensure a healthy
  community and project, such as our [[Code of
  Conduct|contribute/working_together/code_of_conduct]], [[Social
  Contract|contribute/working_together/social_contract]], and [[Missions
  and values|contribute/mission]].

[[!img users-budget.svg link="no" alt=""]]

Sustainability cannot go without enjoying working together and having
fun. We had memorable gatherings where we danced to the
privacy-protecting sound of [Rockwell &mdash; Somebody's Watching
Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YvAYIJSSZY=), [Rap News &mdash;
Whistleblower](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aiZjD0_mTA), [Pete
Seeger &mdash; The Onion Makes Us Strong
(*sic*)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCnEAH5wCzo), [The Police
&mdash; Every Breath You
Take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMOGaugKpzs), and [Cyndi Lauper
&mdash; Girls Just Want To Fix Bugs
(*sic*)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIb6AZdTr-A), ate delicious
[[vegan mafé|mafe]] from our beloved cooking team, and squashed an
[[!tails_ticket 11140 desc="anarchist coup d'état"]].

In 2018 and 2019:

- 66 different people contributed to our main source code, including
  coders, writers, and translators.
- 22 different people were paid to work on Tails: a few of them
  full-time, most of them part-time or as consultants.
- We attended 21 conferences in 10 different countries to stay connected
  with the communities of the Tails ecosystem: related Free Software
  projects, digital security trainers, and users.
- 20 people, both workers and volunteers, attended our yearly
  gatherings.

Meanwhile, we counted no less than [[21
projects|doc/about/acknowledgments_and_similar_projects#similar_projects]],
who also tried to build a live operating system for privacy and
anonymity but are now abandoned.

A big thank you to everybody who either contributed to Tails or
supported us:

- All the people mentioned in this article one way or another
- The people from other related Free Software projects that Tails relies
  upon
- The thousands of activists, journalists, and human-rights defenders who are
  using Tails everyday
- The digital security trainers and technologists who got excited about
  Tails in its early days and continue advocating for it today
- Everybody who ever contributed to our source code, including the
  dozens of translators
- Our [[partners, sponsors|partners]], and everybody who ever donated to
  Tails.

Thank you!
