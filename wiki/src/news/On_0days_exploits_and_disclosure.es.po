"Tails ships a lot of software, from the Linux kernel to a fully functional "

"Security issues are discovered every month in a few of these programs.  Some "
"people report such vulnerabilities, and then they get fixed: This is the "
"power of free and open source software. Others don't disclose them, but run "
"lucrative businesses by weaponizing and selling them instead. This is not "
"new and [comes as no surprise](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/03/zero-"

"We were not contacted by Exodus Intel prior to their tweet. In fact, a more "
"irritated version of this text was ready when we finally received an email "
"from them. They informed us that they would provide us with a report within "
"a week. We're told they won't disclose these vulnerabilities publicly before "
"we have corrected it, and Tails users have had a chance to upgrade. We think "
"that this is the right process to responsibly disclose vulnerabilities, and "
"we're really looking forward to read this report."
