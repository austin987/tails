"Using HTTPS instead of plain HTTP to connect to a website allows you to "
"encrypt your communication with the server. But encryption alone does not "
"guarantee that you are talking with the right server, and not someone "
"impersonating it, for example in case of a [[man-in-the-middle attack|doc/"
"about/warning#man-in-the-middle]]."
msgstr ""
"使用 HTTPS 取代明文的 HTTP "
"來進行網站連線，可以加密訪客與伺服器之間的通訊。但只有加密並不能保證用戶是和正確的伺服器通話，難保不會有人假借身份，例如在[[中間人攻擊|doc/"

"SSL certificates try to solve this problem. A SSL certificate is usually "
"issued by a certificate authority to certify the identity of a server. When "
"you reach a website your web browser might trust an SSL certificate "
"automatically if it trusts the authority that issued it."
msgstr ""
"SSL 憑證正試圖克服這個難題，  SSL "
"憑證通常由憑證授權機關所發以證明某個伺服器的身份。當用戶利用瀏覽器訪問某網站時，如果瀏覽器信任這個憑證單位的話，即會可自動相信它的 SSL 憑證。"

"Commercial certificate authorities are making a living out of selling SSL "
"certificates; they are usually trusted automatically by most of the "
"browsers.  Other non-commercial authorities, such as [CACert](http://www."
"cacert.org/), need to be installed by the operating system or by the user to "
"avoid displaying a security warning when visiting the website."
msgstr ""
"商用憑證機構靠出售 SSL 憑證為生，它們往往為大多數瀏覽器所自動信任。其它的非商業授權機構如 [CACert](http://www.cacert."
"org/)，則需要安裝作業系統或是用戶在訪問該網站時手動來避免顯示安全警告訊息。"

"But this trust system has proven to be flawed in many ways. For example, "
