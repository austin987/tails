"Every network device (wired, Wi-Fi/wireless, 3G/mobile) has a [[!wikipedia "
"MAC address]], which is a unique identifier used to address them on the "
"local network. Broadcasting a unique identifier in this manner introduce a "
"couple of potential privacy issues for Tails users. Geographical location "
"tracking is the main one: observing a MAC address at a particular location "
"and time ties the corresponding device to the same location and time. If the "
"real identity of the device's owner is known, their movements can be "
"determined. To prevent this one can temporarily change the MAC address to "
"something random at each boot, which is referred to as \"MAC address spoofing"
