"On the same day Tails 0.10 was put out, our website started to use a "

"Using HTTPS instead of plain HTTP to connect to a website allows you to "
"encrypt your communication with the server. But encryption alone does not "
"guarantee that you are talking with the right server, and not someone "
"impersonating it, for example in case of a [[man-in-the-middle attack|doc/"
"about/warning#man-in-the-middle]]."

"SSL certificates try to solve this problem. A SSL certificate is usually "
"issued by a certificate authority to certify the identity of a server. When "
"you reach a website your web browser might trust an SSL certificate "
"automatically if it trusts the authority that issued it."

"Commercial certificate authorities are making a living out of selling SSL "
"certificates; they are usually trusted automatically by most of the "
"browsers.  Other non-commercial authorities, such as [CACert](http://www."
"cacert.org/), need to be installed by the operating system or by the user to "
"avoid displaying a security warning when visiting the website."

"But this trust system has proven to be flawed in many ways. For example, "
"during 2011, two certificate authorities were compromised, and many fake "
"certificates were issued and used in the wild. See [Comodo: The Recent RA "
"Compromise](http://blogs.comodo.com/it-security/data-security/the-recent-ra-"

"It is clear for us that getting an commercial SSL certificate is not enough "
