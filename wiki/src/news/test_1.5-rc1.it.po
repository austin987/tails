"  * Major new features\n"
"    - Move LAN web browsing from Tor Browser to the Unsafe Browser,\n"
"      and forbid access to the LAN from the former.\n"
"    - Install a 32-bit GRUB EFI boot loader. This at least works\n"
"      on some Intel Baytrail systems.\n"
"    - Upgrade Tor Browser to 5.0a4-build3.\n"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#, no-wrap
msgid ""
"  * Security fixes\n"
"    - Fix panic mode on MAC spoofing failure.\n"
"    - Deny Tor Browser access to global tmp directories with AppArmor.\n"
"    - Tails Installer: don't use a predictable file name for the subprocess\n"
"      error log.\n"
"    - Pidgin AppArmor profile: disable the launchpad-integration abstraction.\n"
"    - Use aliases so that our AppArmor policy applies to\n"
"      `/lib/live/mount/overlay/` and `/lib/live/mount/rootfs/*.squashfs/` as well as\n"
"      it applies to `/`.\n"
"    - Upgrade Linux to 3.16.7-ckt11-1+deb8u2.\n"
"    - Upgrade bind9-host, dnsutils and friends to 1:9.8.4.dfsg.P1-6+nmu2+deb7u6.\n"
"    - Upgrade cups-filters to 1.0.18-2.1+deb7u2.\n"
"    - Upgrade ghostscript to 9.05~dfsg-6.3+deb7u2.\n"
"    - Upgrade libexpat1 to 2.1.0-1+deb7u2.\n"
"    - Upgrade libicu48 to 4.8.1.1-12+deb7u3.\n"
"    - Upgrade libwmf0.2-7 to 0.2.8.4-10.3+deb7u1.\n"
"    - Upgrade openjdk-7 to 7u79-2.5.6-1~deb7u1.\n"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#, no-wrap
msgid ""
"  * Bugfixes\n"
"    - Upgrade Tor to 0.2.6.10-1~d70.wheezy+1+tails1.\n"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#, no-wrap
msgid ""
"  * Minor improvements\n"
"    - Tails Installer: let the user know when it has rejected a candidate\n"
"      destination device because it is too small.\n"
"    - Tails Installer: prevent users from trying to \"upgrade\" a device\n"
"      that contains no Tails, or that was not installed with Tails Installer.\n"
"    - Install libotr5 and pidgin-otr 4.x from wheezy-backports. This adds\n"
"      support for the OTRv3 protocol and for multiple concurrent connections\n"
"      to the same account.\n"
"    - Skip warning dialog when starting Tor Browser while being offline,\n"
"      in case it is already running. Thanks to Austin English for the patch!\n"
"    - Install the apparmor-profiles package, but don't ship\n"
"      a bunch of AppArmor profiles we don't use, to avoid increasing\n"
"      boot time.\n"
"    - Ship a `/etc/apparmor.d/tunables/home.d/tails` snippet, instead\n"
"      of patching `/etc/apparmor.d/tunables/home`.\n"
"    - live-boot: don't mount tmpfs twice on `/live/overlay`, so that the one which\n"
"      is actually used as the read-write branch of the root filesystem's union\n"
"      mount, is visible.\n"
