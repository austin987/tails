"  * Rebase on Debian Wheezy\n"
"    - Upgrade literally thousands of packages.\n"
"    - Migrate to GNOME3 fallback mode.\n"
"    - Install LibreOffice instead of OpenOffice.\n"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text

"  * Major new features\n"
"    - UEFI boot support, which should make Tails boot on modern\n"
"      hardware and Mac computers.\n"
"    - Replace the Windows XP camouflage with a Windows 8 camouflage.\n"
"    - Bring back VirtualBox guest modules, installed from Wheezy\n"
"      backports. Full functionality is only available when using the\n"
"      32-bit kernel.\n"

"  * Security fixes\n"
"    - Fix write access to boot medium via udisks ([[!tails_ticket 6172]]).\n"
"    - Upgrade the web browser to 24.7.0esr-0+tails1~bpo70+1\n"
"      (Firefox 24.7.0esr + Iceweasel patches + Torbrowser patches).\n"
"    - Upgrade to Linux 3.14.12-1 (fixes CVE-2014-4699).\n"
"    - Make persistent file permissions safer ([[!tails_ticket 7443]]).\n"

"  * Minor improvements\n"
"    - Don't install Gobby 0.4 anymore. Gobby 0.5 has been available in\n"
"      Debian since Squeeze, now is a good time to drop the obsolete\n"
"      0.4 implementation.\n"
"    - Require a bit less free memory before checking for upgrades with\n"
"      Tails Upgrader. The general goal is to avoid displaying \"Not\n"
"      enough memory available to check for upgrades\" too often due to\n"
"      over-cautious memory requirements checked in the wrapper.\n"
"    - Whisperback now sanitizes attached logs better with respect to\n"
"      DMI data, IPv6 addresses, and serial numbers ([[!tails_ticket\n"
"      6797]], [[!tails_ticket 6798]], [[!tails_ticket 6804]]).\n"
"    - Install the BookletImposer PDF imposition toolkit.\n"
