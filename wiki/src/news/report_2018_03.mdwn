Releases
========

March was a heavy month regarding Tails releases: shortly after
putting out the Tails 3.6 major release, we had to publish an
emergency 3.6.1 release to fix security issues identified at Pwn2Own,
and finally we had to prepare another emergency release (3.6.2) that
was released in April. Due to an unfortunate combination of software
development and release management mistakes, applying these upgrades
was harder than usual for Tails users; apologies!

* [[Tails 3.6 was released on March 13|news/version_3.6]] (major release).

* Tails 3.7 is [[scheduled for May 8|contribute/calendar]].

The following changes were introduced in Tails 3.6:

- You can now lock your screen by clicking on the
  *Lock* button in the system menu.

  - If you set up an [[administration password|doc/first_steps/startup_options/administration_password]]
    when starting Tails, you can unlock your screen with your administration
    password.
  - Otherwise, you can set up a password to unlock your screen when locking your
    screen for the first time.

- We improved a lot the backend of the [[**Additional Software**
  persistence feature|doc/first_steps/persistence/configure#additional_software]].
  Your additional software is now:

  - Installed in the background after the session starts instead of
    blocking the opening of the desktop.
  - Always installed even if you are offline.

- Install
  [pdf-redact-tools](https://github.com/firstlookmedia/pdf-redact-tools/blob/master/README.md),
  a command line tool to clean metadata and redact PDF files by
  converting them to PNG images.

- An error message indicating the name of the graphics card is now
  displayed when Tails fails to start GNOME.

- The **Tails documentation** launcher on the desktop now opens the
  documentation on our website if you are online.

- We activated the *AppArmor* profile for *Thunderbird* from Debian
  to [[confine *Thunderbird* for security|contribute/design/application_isolation]].

- Rewrite some internal scripts from shell scripting to Python, thanks
  to [GoodCrypto](https://goodcrypto-private-server.sourceforge.io/).

- Remove the display of debug and error messages when starting.

- Fix the ISO image selection being unavailable in *Tails Installer* in
  languages other than English. ([[!tails_ticket 15233]])

- Fix *OpenPGP Applet* being unresponsive when decrypting a lot of text.
  ([[!tails_ticket 6398]])

The following changes were introduced in Tails 3.6.1:

- Update *Tor Browser* to 7.5.2.

  This fixes a [critical issue in
  Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2018-08/)
  announced on March 16.

- This release is [[reproducible|contribute/build/reproducible]], unlike
  Tails 3.6. ([[!tails_ticket 15400]])

Code
====

- The homepage for our *OpenPGP Applet*, previously hosted on [Alioth](https://openpgp-applet.alioth.debian.org) has been moved to Alioth's successor, [Salsa](https://salsa.debian.org). The address is now <https://openpgp-applet-team.pages.debian.net> and the project (code repository and issue tracker) is reachable at <https://salsa.debian.org/openpgp-applet-team/openpgp-applet>, continuing the project of upstreaming this code so that you can use it outside of Tails. Also, version 1.1 as been released, fixing some long-standing bugs.

- We released [*Tails Verification*
  1.0](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tails-verification/)
  with some minor improvements from an expert review, updated jQuery and
  Forge libraries, and a fixed the download link on retry.

  We also [[documented the security aspects of *Tails
  Verification*|contribute/design/verification_extension#inside_the_browser]].

- We have worked on a number of regressions that were introduced in
  Tails 3.6. Many fixes made their way into Tails 3.6.2
  ([[!tails_ticket 15434]], [[!tails_ticket 15437]],
  [[!tails_ticket 15433]], [[!tails_ticket 15400]],
  [[!tails_ticket 15449]], [[!tails_ticket 15371]]) but a few
  remaining issues require further investigation or have fixes waiting
  for review upstream.

- We made great progress on our SponsorW-funded project:
  - Regarding
    [[!tails_ticket 14468 desc="adding VeraCrypt support to GNOME"]],
    the libblockdev bits were merged upstream and the udisks one are
    in good way to be merged as well, and we made progress on the
    GNOME Files side.
  - Regarding
    [[!tails_ticket 14568 desc="Additional Software Packages"]], the
    backend and the GUI components are implemented; code review and
    implementation of automated tests have started.

Documentation and website
=========================

We documented how to:

- [[Save the configuration of your
  displays|doc/first_steps/persistence/configure#displays]] if you have
  more than one display (for example, two monitors or a projector).

- [[Reproduce a bug in Debian|doc/first_steps/bug_reporting#debian]]
  when reporting an error (for advanced users).

- [[Use *Tails Installer* to do a manual upgrade from
  3.5|upgrade/tails#3.5]] in languages other than English.

We also made the [[output of the GnuPG command line to verify an ISO
image|install/download#openpgp]] more consistent across different
versions of GnuPG.

User experience
===============

- From a session at the Internet Freedom Festival, we took notes on how
  [[participants used the metaphor of a tent to describe
  Tails|blueprint/explain_tails#iff]]:

  - It's *portable*: you can store it in your backpack.
  - It's *amnesic*: it's empty every time you set it up.
  - It's *incognito*: you can move it around and it looks like other tents.

- We started discussing a collaboration with [Simply
  Secure](https://simplysecure.org/) to explain better what is Tails.
  The goals are both to reach a consensus among contributors and to make
  it easier to explain Tails to the world.

Hot topics on our help desk
===========================

1. Several users complained about
   [[!tails_ticket 15432 desc="Tails Installer failing"]].

2. And there seems to be more people complaining about
   [[!tails_ticket 10976 desc="losing their Persistent Volume"]]
   than usual.

Infrastructure
==============

- We've worked on a more detailed scheme to include our web translation
  platform into our workflow ([[!tails_ticket 10034]]).

- We documented our [[survey
  platform|contribute/how/user_experience/limesurvey]].

Funding
=======

- We submitted again our proposal for the work on [[distributing USB
  images|blueprint/usb_install_and_upgrade]] to the [NLnet call for
  funding](nlhttps://nlnet.nl/news/2018/20180401-call-en.html).

- We participated in the [DuckDuckGo Privacy
  Challenge](https://www.crowdrise.com/duckduckgoprivacychallenge). We
  raised $4 235 and rank 5th on March 28.

- Our fundraising team got a new member. Welcome aboard!

Outreach
========

Past events
-----------

- Emma Peel and sajolida where at the [Internet Freedom
  Festival](https://internetfreedomfestival.org/) where they
  participated in several sessions on documentation and user experience
  and presented Tails in the tools showcase.

- anonym and intrigeri attended the Tor meeting in Rome. We've had
  lots of interesting discussions there, including heart-warming ones
  about how Tails could work more closely with the Tor project in
  the future.

- Tails was presented by jvoisin at the
  [Journées FedeRez](https://www.federez.net/journees/2018/) in Paris,
  France. The slides (in French) are available
  [here](https://dustri.org/b/tails-aux-journees-federez-2018.html).

Upcoming events
---------------

- Tails contributors will attend [CryptoRave](https://cryptorave.org/)
  (São Paulo, May 4-5) and will run a number of Tails/Tor-related
  events there, including a users meetup aimed at gathering feedback
  and better understanding who our users are, what they do with Tails,
  what works well and what is problematic. If you're around São Paulo,
  join us there! :)

Press and testimonials
======================

* 2018-03-19: Edward Snowden retweeted about our participation to the
  DuckDuckGo Privacy Challenge [explaining](https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/975827513321623553):

  <blockquote>
  <p>Because I've used @Tails_live for years. The journalists who broke the
  mass surveillance revelations of 2013 all relied on it. Free, libre, and
  open source software projects quietly save the world every day, even
  when you can't see it, and their success depends on your support.</p>
