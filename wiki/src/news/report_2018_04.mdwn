Releases
========

There have been no releases in April (a big change compared to the three
releases in March!).

* Tails 3.7 is [[scheduled for May 8|contribute/calendar]].

Code
====

* We kept working with upstream to be able to [support VeraCrypt in
  GNOME](https://github.com/storaged-project/udisks/pull/495).

* [MAT2](https://0xacab.org/jvoisin/mat2) is being developed. Lots of
  improvements, will come with support for new formats (torrents!) and
  more.

* We worked on the new [[Additional Software
  feature|blueprint/additional_software_packages/gui]], that will be
  ready for Tails 3.9 and will make programs easy to install each time
  you start Tails (as long as they are available from
  [[Debian|support/faq/#software]]).

Documentation and website
=========================

- We wrote a new page to list [[known issues with graphics
  cards|support/known_issues/graphics]]. Combined with the better error message
  when GDM fails to start that we introduced in [[Tails 3.6|news/version_3.6]],
  it should gradually improve a lot the experience of people who cannot start
  Tails with their graphics card.

User experience
===============

- We started designing a [quantitative survey of our user
  base](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-ux/2018-April/003540.html).

  What would be useful for us to know about our users?

- We drafted a [[fourth persona skeleton|personas#derya]].

- We removed the zooming effect on the screenshots in our installation
  instructions which was annoying. ([[!tails_ticket 14678]])

Hot topics on our help desk
===========================

1. Users are still affected by [[a loss of
   persistence.conf|https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/10976]]

1. We received also several reports about [[keyboard and mouse not
   working after upgrading|https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/14754]]

1. A few users reported the [[disappearance of a part of their
   keyring|https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/15014]]

1. And some users had [[trouble with obfs4
   bridges|https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/15548]]

Infrastructure
==============

- We documented our [[LimeSurvey
  installation|contribute/how/user_experience/limesurvey]].

# Funding

- We participated in the DuckDuckGo Privacy Challenge. We raised
  $9&thinsp;870 in donations and will receive $33&thinsp;000 in prizes
  from DuckDuckGo.

  Thanks a lot to everybody who participated!

- The italian association "Mutuo Soccorso", in their last book "Stop al Panico!
  Difesa legale, note per una maggiore consapevolezza", "Don't Panic!Legal
  defense, notes for greater awareness" - Bologna march 2018, suggests use
  Tails (p 132) for high needs of anonimity, to circumvent the
  censorships, or to manage in an easy way confidential communications.
