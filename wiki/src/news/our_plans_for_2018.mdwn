As part of our current donation campaign, we recently explained that
many hands make Tails or [[why we need donations|many_hands_make_tails]]
and [[what we accomplished this year|what_we_accomplished]].
Today we are sharing with you some of our plans for the next years:

### Applications and features

- **Tails Server**: run onion services from Tails (VoIP chat rooms,
  collaboration tools, web servers, messaging servers, etc.). *This
  feature will be published and usable in Tails in the beginning of
  2018.*
- **VeraCrypt support in GNOME**: graphical utilities to mount VeraCrypt
  volumes. *We are working on this feature and plan to publish it during
  the second half of 2018.*
- **Graphical interface for the Additional Packages persistent
  feature**: allow users to customize which applications are available
  in their Tails. *This feature shall be included in Tails during the
  second half of 2018.*
- **Mobile messaging applications**: we want to investigate if we could
  support Signal, Wire, Telegram, etc. in Tails ([[!tails_ticket
  14504]]).

### User research and support

- **Power our help desk with a request tracker** to know better how to
  help our user base at large ([[!tails_ticket 9803]],
  [[Blueprint|blueprint/RT_for_help_desk]])

### Better adoption

- **Rethink the installation and upgrade process** in depth and reflect
  on the future of *Tails Installer*, the installation on Windows and
  macOS, and automatic upgrades ([[!tails_ticket 11679]])
- **Give some love to our troubleshooting documentation**:
  - Our [[known issues page|support/known_issues]] ([[!tails_ticket
    11665]])
  - Computers with unsupported Wi-Fi devices, very common on Mac
    ([[!tails_ticket 11683]])

### Resistance to remote exploitation

- **Persistent Tor state** to have persistent entry guards
  ([[!tails_ticket 5462]], [[Blueprint|blueprint/persistent_Tor_state]])
- **Persistent seed for random number generator** to have stronger
  crypto ([[!tails_ticket 7675]],
  [[Blueprint|blueprint/randomness_seeding]])
- **Have critical parts of Tails audited** ([[!tails_ticket 14508]])
- **Switch to Wayland** ([[!tails_ticket 12213]])

These are all items that we find important and want to prioritize. But making
them a reality will require lots of work, time, and money; on top of all the
day-to-day work that we do to simply keep Tails alive.

If you want us to get there faster, please take one minute to make a donation.
