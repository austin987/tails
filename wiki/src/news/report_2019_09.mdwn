Releases
========

* [[Tails 3.16 was released on September 4|news/version_3.16]] (major release).

* Tails 4.0 is [[scheduled for October 22|contribute/calendar]].

These are some of the changes that were introduced in Tails 3.16:

* Removed pre-generated Pidgin accounts
* Removed LibreOffice Math
* Upgraded Tor Browser to 8.5.5

Code
====

* We started to integrate _Tor Browser_ 9.0 ([[!tails_ticket 16356]]).

* We started working on the upgrade to _Thunderbird_ 68
  ([[!tails_ticket 16771]]).

* We did lots of work to improve the reliability of our test suite.

* We did some initial research and tests on using _Portals_ to improve
  the UX of saving downloaded files from _Tor Browser_ ([[!tails_ticket
  10422]], [[!tails_ticket 15678]]).

* We did some initial research on redesigning, in a Wayland-compatible
  way, our current sudo-based privilege separation model
  ([[!tails_ticket 12213]] and subtasks).

* We improved the UX of the _Greeter_ and fixed a few of its most
  annoying bugs ([[!tails_ticket 16095]] and the tickets it blocks).
  This work will hopefully land in time for Tails 4.0 :)

Documentation and website
=========================

- We rewrote completely the instructions to [[backup the persistent
  volume|doc/first_steps/persistence/copy]].

- We documented how to do right-click on Mac. ([[!tails_ticket 15718]])

- We proposed to use Trimage to compress better the images on our
  website. ([[!tails_ticket 17099]])

- We agreed on having a "People" page. ([[!tails_ticket 17046]])

User experience
===============

- We published a job offer on [[illustrations on what is Tails and how
  it works|jobs/illustrations_how_tails_work]].

- We did some stats on how good people upgrade their Tails, with data
  from April 2019. ([[!tails_ticket 17069#note-4]])

  - 16.6% of boots (3800/day) had no direct automatic upgrade path to
    the latest version because they were more than 3 months old.

  - 3.8% of boots (860/day) were stuck before 3.6, which had broken all
    automatic upgrades. The impact of breaking all automatic upgrades in
    3.6 was still huge even 1 year later.

Hot topics on our help desk
===========================

* Unfortunately we had some problems with [[!tails_ticket 17110 desc="our
  WhisperBack system"]], and because of that, some users were prevented
  from contacting us.
  We are looking into how to prevent so much downtime the next time.

* [[!tails_ticket 15548 desc="Tails can't establish a connection with
  obfs4 bridges and a hardware clock too far away from UTC"]] is still
  ongoing

* Graphics cards still give problems to some users ([[!tails_ticket 16447]])


Infrastructure
==============

* We upgraded our very old Jenkins to the current LTS version
  ([[!tails_ticket 10068]]). This in turn allowed us to implement
  a bunch of improvements and bugfixes that had been blocked by this
  postponed upgrade.

* We kept working on making our [web translation
  platform](https://translate.tails.boum.org/) ready for prime-time.
  We're almost there!

Funding
=======

- We submitted a joint grant proposal with Tor and the
  Guardian Project to the DRL Internet Freedom program.

- We added Monero and Zcash as cryptocurrencies in which you can [[donate
  to Tails|donate#cryptos]].

- We received a $1 000 donation from [[TOP10VPN|partners]].

- We prepared most of the content for our upcoming donation campaign:
  banner, blog posts, email, tweets, etc. ([[!tails_ticket 16096]])
