Releases
========

* Tails 3.9 is scheduled for September 5. Its release candidate
  is scheduled for August 17.

Code
====

We did most of the work needed to upgrade to Tor Browser 8,
based on Firefox 60ESR.

We continued to work on including VeraCrypt in Tails.

We continued our work on creating a user interface for our Additional
Software feature to make it easier to use.

We worked on new Debian packages for Torbirdy, Tails Installer and
OnionShare.

We prepared
[a fix](https://ikiwiki.info/todo/Re-use_translated_content_instead_of_skipping_if_previously_translated/)
for a long standing bug in ikiwiki that makes our website render in
a buggy way regularly.

We worked more on integrating our future web translation platform with
our infrastructure. This platform is currently not production ready but
is being tested and used by a few translators.

- We wrote Git hooks for all machines and contributors using Git.

- We wrote and improved several scripts that check the validity of PO
  files that we carry. We need these scripts to further automate our
  translation processes, hence all translators, humans and interfaces
  need to respect certain rules when committing PO files to our
  repository. This is currently not active and still needs to be tested
  more extensively.

- We are working on ikiwiki, our website engine, to support adding
  translation files for non-active languages.

Documentation and website
=========================

We updated our [[installation instructions for Debian|install/debian/usb]] to:

- Linux Mint 19

- Tails Installer with no splash screen

User experience
===============

We designed interfaces to:

- Persist the screen locking password ([[!tails_ticket 15641]]).

- Attach screenshots to *WhisperBack* reports ([[!tails_ticket 8660]]).

Hot topics on our help desk
===========================



1. Users complained about GDM not starting (most of them with Intel GPU [[!tails_ticket 15700]]).
1. Some others were unable to use Wi-Fi (non supported USB adapters and [[!tails_ticket 15520]]).

1. Enigmail setup wizard [[!tails_ticket 15693]] generated some requests.

1. And still a few [[!tails_ticket 10976 desc="lost persistence"]] reports. Remember:  we need the debugging info from a session in which the persistence seems to be lost, to be able to fix this. More information [here](https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/10976#note-16).


Infrastructure
==============

We asked [Wikimedia](https://mirrors.wikimedia.org/) to become our
primary fallback download mirror, and they accepted. We'll implement
this change in the coming months.  Thank you Wikimedia!

We've updated our web translation platform to a recent version. The
process went smoothly.

We started looking into the long-term viability of Dogtail,
one of the key components of our automated testing framework.

Funding
=======

- We analyzed the results from last year's donation campaign.

  We got more money than in 2016 (101&thinsp;664€, +34%) but from less donations (-43%).

Outreach
========

Past events
-----------

- sajolida attended [PETS](https://petsymposium.org).

- Four of us attended [DebConf](https://debconf18.debconf.org) in
  Hsinchu, Taiwan.

- emmapeel attended a dev sprint with Tactical Tech about investigative journalist tools for Tails in Montenegro.

Upcoming events
---------------

- sajolida will be at [Tor meeting in Mexico
  City](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/meetings/2018MexicoCity)
  from September 29 to October 3 and will present Tails during the open
  days on October 2.
