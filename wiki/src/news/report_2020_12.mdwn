In memoriam of Karsten Loesing
==============================

We join the Tor project in [mourning Karsten
Loesing](https://blog.torproject.org/in-memoriam-of-karsten-loesing).
Our sincere condolences to Karsten's family and colleagues.

Those of us who were lucky enough to cross Karsten's path
remember him as a very kind, thoughtful, and smart person.

Rest in peace, Karsten.

Releases
========

* [[Tails 4.14 was released on December 15|news/version_4.14]].

* Tails 4.15 is [[scheduled for January 26|contribute/calendar]].

The following changes were introduced in Tails 4.15:

- Add support for the Ledger hardware wallets in *Electrum*.
  ([[!tails_ticket 15353]])

- Remove the *Unifont* font. ([[!tails_mr 263]])

- Fix Additional Software by updating the APT key for
  `deb.torproject.org`. ([[!tails_ticket 18042]])

- Fix changing the administration password stored in the Persistent
  Storage. ([[!tails_ticket 18018]])

- Fix opening the Persistent Storage of another Tails USB stick in
  the *Files* browser. ([[!tails_ticket 18050]])

- Restore automatically a *GnuPG* public keyring from its backup when it
  gets corrupt. ([[!tails_ticket 17807]])

🎉 New core developer 🎂
========================

Today, we celebrate the arrival in our [[Foundations
Team|contribute/working_together/roles/foundations_team]] of a new member:
boyska. His skills and experience in operating systems, software development,
and collective projects will:

 - Accelerate development of new features, user experience improvements, and
   bug fixes.

 - Make our day-to-day maintenance work more sustainable.

   This work has no visible impact most of the time, except that Tails is still
   alive after more than a decade, and here to stay!

 - Decrease our reliance on a tiny number of key persons.

   This is one important step we're taking, among others, towards making Tails
   a healthier project.

> I'm boyska, a fellow who always loved computers. When I realized the
> profound social implications of technology, I tried to make my part:

> general.
> A post-it note in my brain remembers me that computing should be fun,
> not scary.


Additionally, we would like to thank:

 - the thousands of people whose donation allowed us to fund this new position

   Please consider [[donating today|donate]] to fight surveillance and censorship.

 - the dozens of people who applied to this [[job offer|jobs/Linux_generalist]]

   It's been truly heart-warming to see so many great applicants
   interested in working with us.

Welcome, boyska! :)

Code
====

- We implemented a mechanism for adding a "Don't Show Again" button to some
  notifications. We'll try it out in Tails 4.15 for the warning displayed when
  starting Tails in a virtual machine; then we'll iterate from there.

- We finished porting our Python code to Python 3. Yeah!

- We made plans for rewriting _Persistent Storage_ in Python, making it
  compatible with Wayland, and redesigning its UX from scratch.

Documentation and website
=========================

- Started rewriting /doc/about/warning:

  * Samuel DiBella rewrote the section about [[contextual identities|doc/about/warning#identities]]
    ([[!tails_ticket 17882]])

  * We rewrote the sections about [[confirmation attacks and global
    adversaries|doc/about/warning#correlation]] ([[!tails_ticket 17869]])

- Added an FAQ about "[[Is it safe to use an older version of
  Tails?|support/faq#older-version]]" ([[!tails_ticket 18001]])

- Improved our [[security|security]] page and replaced "hole" by "vulnerability" everywhere
  on our website, as per our style guide. ([[!tails_ticket 18032]])

User experience
===============

- Started analyzing the search queries on our website,
  following a [methodology by Susan Farrell](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/search-log-analysis/).
  ([[!tails_ticket 11649]])

- Started preparing the redesign of the Persistent Storage that we'll work on
  in January. ([[!tails_ticket 15572]])

- Investigated what it would take to stop distributing ISO images:

  * [[!tails_ticket 18047]]: Users unintentionally install ISO to USB instead of the .img
  * [[!tails_ticket 18054]]: Distribute USB images by default for all virtual machines
  * [[!tails_ticket 18055]]: Stop distributing ISO images

- Added some depth to the buttons on our website. ([[!tails_ticket 15111]])

Funding
=======

Grants
------

- Our proposal to the UXFund to work on a replacement for Tor Launcher
  was approved buy scaled down by 20%.

Donations
---------

- Received 57.8k€ from 88 donations at CCT since the beginning of the
  campaign.

  It's 70% more donations, that's the important part, and 599%
  more money thanks to a 50k€ donation from some crypto trading company, that's
  the big cherry on top of the cake!

- Blogged about our [[achievements in 2020|news/achievements_in_2020]].

Sponsors
--------

- Renamed "partners" as "[[sponsors|sponsors]]" after DeepOnion listed Tails as their
  partner on their website.

  The word "partners" implies reciprocity and a deeper relationship,
  while the word "sponsor" doesn't and is more accurate, honest, and
  common.

- Got invited to the [Lifetime Raffle](https://protonmail.com/blog/lifetime-account-auction-2020/)
  of ProtonMail.

Outreach
========

Past events
-----------

* Tails and Tor were presented (among other tools) to journalism students at
  [Sciences Po Rennes](http://www.sciencespo-rennes.fr/en/) (Rennes, France) as
  part of their digital safety lessons.
