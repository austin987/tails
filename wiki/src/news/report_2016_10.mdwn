Releases
========

* Tails 2.7 is [[scheduled for November 15|contribute/calendar]].

Code
====

* The branch for [OnionShare](https://onionshare.org) support was much
  improved and is now ready for review ([[!tails_ticket 7870]]).
  This required a complete rewrite of our Tor control port filter to
  make it a lot more powerful… and in passing, flexible enough for
  Whonix to adopt it.

Infrastructure
==============

* Our test suite covers 213 scenarios, 4 more that at the end of September.

* 575 ISO images were automatically built and tested by our continuous integration infrastructure.

* We published a mechanism for the [[distribution and activation of the
  revocation certificate of the Tails signing
  key|doc/about/openpgp_keys/signing_key_revocation]]. It allows revoking
  the Tails signing key even if very bad things happens to most of the
  team while making it hard for isolated and malicious individuals to revoke
  the signing key when not needed. We encourage experts to review this
  mechanism and other projects to adopt similar practices.

Funding
=======

- We launched a donation campaign to run until the end of 2016. We already
  raised [56 bitcoins](https://blockchain.info/charts/balance?timespan=30days&showDataPoints=false&daysAverageString=1&show_header=true&scale=0&address=1BvBMSEYstWetqTFn5Au4m4GFg7xJaNVN2)!

- We published our [[financial report for 2015|doc/about/finances#2015]].

- Our proposal for [NLnet](https://nlnet.nl/foundation/request/) on
  porting Tails to Debian Stretch made it to the second round.

Outreach
========

- DrWhax, intrigeri, and sajolida attended the OTF summit. It was a wonderful
  opportunity to strengthen our relationships with the Internet freedom
  community at large: other operating systems, usability experts,
  translators, technical writers, funders, trainers, and Tails enthusiasts in
  general, etc.

On-going discussions
====================

* [Improving memory erasure on shutdown](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2016-October/010991.html)
* [Tails control port filter proxy in Whonix?](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2016-October/010996.html)
* A second meeting took place to improve random pool seeding
  ([[blueprint|blueprint/randomness_seeding]],
  [[!tails_ticket 7675]]); other meetings will follow.
