Releases
========

Late May we decided to [postpone the release of Tails
1.1](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2014-May/005901.html), based
on Debian Wheezy, to the next release cycle. And instead have Tails 1.0.1
released on June 10.

Tails 1.1~beta1, the first beta version of Tails based on Debian Wheezy, was released
on May 30.

Metrics
=======

- Tails has been started more than 344 328 times this month.
  This make 11 107 boots a day in average.
- 31 698 downloads of the OpenPGP signature of Tails ISO.
- 64 bug reports were received through WhisperBack.

FAQ
===

- The development of TrueCrypt [was
  discontinued](http://truecrypt.sourceforge.net/) but our position regarding
  TrueCrypt has remained the same for years: Tails includes TrueCrypt only for
  backward compatibility and we are working on [[choosing a free software as
  replacement|blueprint/replace_truecrypt]] to open TrueCrypt volumes. We hope
  that this recent announcement encourages users to migrate to other
  encrypted storage formats such as [[LUKS|support/faq#luks]], and
  developers to better [[!tails_ticket 6337 desc="support the TrueCrypt
  on-disk format"]]  in Free Software tools.

Code
====

Still, a lot of work has been done to prepare Tails 1.1:

  - The Windows Camouflage has been upgraded to Windows 8 ([[!tails_ticket
    6342]]). It mostly works but some visual improvements would make it nicer
    ([[!tails_ticket 7377]]).
  - Fixed the build of VirtualBox guest modules ([[!tails_ticket 5972]]).
  - Fixed the starting of ORCA screen reader ([[!tails_ticket 7251]]).
  - Fixed the keymap selection from Tails Greeter ([[!tails_ticket 7065]]).
  - Set the background of Tails Greeter to our usual blue color ([[!tails_ticket
    7126]]).
  - Fixed OpenPGP signature verification in Nautilus ([[!tails_ticket 6608]]).
    That implied installing a backport of shared-mime-info 1.2+ ([[!tails_ticket
    7058]]).
  - Worked on
    upgrading liferea
    ([[!tails_ticket 7154]]) and
    adding a persistence
    feature ([[!tails_ticket 5711]]), but we discovered that Liferea > 1.10.3
    includes a general-purpose web browser with JavaScript, and we don't want
    that. We are now considering to wait for Icedove, which also has a feed
    reader, before we add a persistent feeds feature.
  - Fixed the display of non-Latin script in Florence ([[!tails_ticket 7279]]).
  - Used a solid blue background color to workaround a display bug in GNOME
    Fallback ([[!tails_ticket 7248]]).
  - Adapted the test suite to Wheezy was completed
    ([[!tails_ticket 6559]]).
  - Used the regular GnuPG agent instead of the one from GNOME Keyring
    ([[!tails_ticket 7330]]).
  - Fixed emergency shutdown before login ([[!tails_ticket 7333]]).
  - Prevented `iproute2` from being installed from wheezy-backports
    ([[!tails_ticket 7337]]).
  - Purged `dselect` ([[!tails_ticket 7336]]).
  - Worked on fixing the migration of NetworkManager persistence settings
    ([[!tails_ticket 7338]]).
  - Tails devices are now converted to UEFI on full upgrade ([[!tails_ticket
    6577]]).
  - Imported I2P 0.9.13 packages for Wheezy ([[!tails_ticket 6731]]).

Apart from all the work directly related to the migration to Wheezy, we also:

  - Backported python-stem ([[!tails_ticket 7318]]).
  - Installed Linux 3.14 ([[!tails_ticket 7150]]).
  - Decreased the memory requirements while checking for upgrades
    ([[!tails_ticket 7235]]).
  - Disabled the update check mechanism of Torbutton ([[!tails_ticket 7097]]).
  - Installed Tor 0.2.4.22 ([[!tails_ticket 7342]]).
  - Included GtkHash to allow checksum computation from Nautilus
    ([[!tails_ticket 6763]]).
  - Updated Tor
    launcher to 0.2.5.4.
  - Worked on using static UID for `tails-persistence-setup` ([[!tails_ticket
    7343]]).
  - Started evaluating [[!debpkg xserver-xorg-video-modesetting]], for
    [[!tails_ticket 7394 desc="KMS support"]] with the Cirrus (used
    e.g. in QEMU), MGA, and maybe other video adapters.

Documentation and website
=========================

  - Many parts of our documentation were adapted to Tails Wheezy.
  - Parts of our download page were reworked and simplified ([[!tails_ticket
    7163]]).
  - Removed the "Why do you need anonymity?" page, which was outside of the scope
    of our documentation.
  - Explain that NoScript is disabled by default ([[!tails_gitweb_commit
    8d79797]]).
  - Put it more clearly that most bug reports without an email address are
    useless ([[!tails_gitweb_commit 5439823]]).
  - Documented that OTR is not activated by default ([[!tails_ticket 7355]]).

Infrastructure
==============

- As our mirror pool grew, we finally hit a [[!tor_bug 11741 desc="bug in the Tor
  DNS resolver"]] that
  prevents us from adding more than about 25 servers in our DNS pool. Thanks to
  foob we put up a [[blueprint|blueprint/HTTP_mirror_pool]] to fix that issue on
  the long-run. See [[!tails_ticket 7161]] and [Some research about mirror
  infrastructure](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2014-May/005748.html).

- Contributors were encouraged to migrate their custom build systems to Wheezy
  ([[!tails_gitweb_commit 65967ea]]), as was done for our Jenkins
  autobuilder already, and to [[!tails_ticket 7218 desc="update our
  Vagrant basebox to Wheezy"]].
