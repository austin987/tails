Amnesia 0.4.1 released

Highlighted changes:

* We now ship "Hybrid" ISO images, which can be either
  burnt on CD-ROM or dd'd to a USB stick or hard disk.
* We now ship multilingual ISO images; initially supported (or rather
  wanna-be-supported) languages are: ar, zh, de, en, fr, it, pt, es.
* Icedove was replaced with claws mail, in a bit rough way.
* Virtual keyboard:  kvkbd was replaced with onBoard.
* Tor controller: TorK was replaced with Vidalia.
* Anonymous, GnuPG-encrypted bug reporting is now made easy, thanks to
  [WhisperBack](https://git.immerda.ch/whisperback/).
* Users are now warned at runtime when the amnesia version they are
  running is affected by security flaws, and which ones they are.

See the [online
Changelog](https://git-tails.immerda.ch/tails/plain/debian/changelog?h=0.4.1)
for details.
