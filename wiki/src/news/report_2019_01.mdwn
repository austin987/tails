Releases
========

* [[Tails 3.12 was released on January 29|news/version_3.12]] (major release).

* Tails 3.13 is [[scheduled for March 19|contribute/calendar]].

The following changes were introduced in Tails 3.12:

* New installation methods
  * [[For macOS|https://tails.boum.org/install/mac/usb-overview/index.en.html]], the new method is much simpler as it uses a graphical tool [[(Etcher)|https://www.balena.io/etcher/]] instead of the command line.
  * [[For Windows|https://tails.boum.org/install/win/usb-overview/index.en.html]], the new method is much faster as it doesn't require 2 USB sticks and an intermediary Tails anymore. The resulting USB stick also works better on newer computers with UEFI.
  * [[For Debian and Ubuntu|https://tails.boum.org/install/linux/usb-overview/index.en.html]], the new method uses a native application (GNOME Disks) and you don't have to install Tails Installer anymore.
  * [[For other Linux distributions|https://tails.boum.org/install/linux/usb-overview/index.en.html]], the new method is faster as it doesn't require 2 USB sticks and an intermediary Tails anymore.
* Starting Tails should be a bit faster on most machines. ([[#15915|https://redmine.tails.boum.org/code/issues/15915]])
* Tell users to use `sudo` when they try to use `su` on the command line.
* Fix the black screen when starting Tails with some Intel graphics cards. ([[#16224|https://redmine.tails.boum.org/code/issues/16224]])

Code
====

- A bunch of Foundations Team members had a sprint focused on porting
  Tails to Debian 10 (Buster). For details, see the
  [full report](https://lists.autistici.org/message/20190112.093556.b591a963.en.html).

Documentation and website
=========================

- We wrote brand new installation instructions using:

  - [[*Etcher* for Windows|install/win/usb]]
  - [[*Etcher* for macOS|install/mac/usb]]
  - [[*GNOME Disks* for Linux|install/linux/usb]]

- We wrote how to [[troubleshoot Wi-Fi not
  working|doc/anonymous_internet/networkmanager]] and which USB Wi-Fi adapters
  work in Tails.

- We documented how to [[disable the automatic screen
  locker|doc/first_steps/introduction_to_gnome_and_the_tails_desktop#screen-locker]]
  if you configure an administration password.

- We added several entries to our writing style guide:

  - [[*vulnerability*|contribute/how/documentation/style_guide#vulnerability]]
  - [[*HTML anchors*|contribute/how/documentation/style_guide#anchors]]
  - [[*update* vs *upgrade*|contribute/how/documentation/style_guide#update]]
  - [[*boot* vs *start*|contribute/how/documentation/style_guide#boot]]
  - [[*network interface*|contribute/how/documentation/style_guide#network-interface]]
  - [[*media*|contribute/how/documentation/style_guide#media]]
  - [[*administration password*|contribute/how/documentation/style_guide#administration-password]]
  - [[*future tense*|contribute/how/documentation/style_guide#future-tense]]
  - [[*earlier* and *later*|contribute/how/documentation/style_guide#earlier]]

User experience
===============

- We published an [[interview with Bea|contribute/how/user_experience/bea]] who is
  spreading the use of Tails in a grassroots political organization in Latin
  America.

- We added visual feedback upstream when opening
  [KeePassXC](https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/pull/2593),
  [Electrum](https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/pull/4997), and
  [OnionShare](https://github.com/micahflee/onionshare/pull/867).

- We [evaluated the cost/benefit of solving many small UX
  improvements](https://redmine.tails.boum.org/code/issues/14544#note-75).

Hot topics on our help desk
===========================

The month started with this questions:

1. [[!tails_ticket 16224 desc="Black screen after the boot menu with Intel GPU (i915)"]]
1. [[!tails_ticket 14754 desc="Partially applied incremental upgrades cause all kinds of trouble"]]

But after the release of Tails 3.12, the hottest topics were:

1. [[!tails_ticket 16447 desc="Regression on some Intel GPU (Braswell, Kaby Lake)"]]
1. [[!tails_ticket 16421 desc="Electrum Phishing Attack - Upstream Fix Committed
"]]

Infrastructure
==============

- Our infrastructure was targeted by a [[!wikipedia Denial-of-service_attack
  desc="distributed denial-of-service (DDoS)"]] attack that caused a
  couple of temporary outages. We're discussing ways to protect ourselves
  in the future.

- We kept polishing the automated test suite for Additional Software
  and hope it will be merged in time for the next Tails release.

- We kept investigating options to make our CI faster, shorten the
  development feedback loop, and thus make our developers' work more
  efficient and pleasurable. We will soon be able to benchmark our
  currently preferred option.

- We dealt with the fallout of the big infrastructure changes done in
  December. A few issues remain but things are starting to run more
  smoothly again :)

Funding
=======

- We close our end-of-year donation campaign. We don't have the final numbers
  yet.

- We submitted 2 applications to the NLnet [NGI Zero
  PET](https://nlnet.nl/PET/) project.
