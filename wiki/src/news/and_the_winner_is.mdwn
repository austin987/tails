Our [[logo contest|logo_contest]] ended up [a few days
ago](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2014-April/005390.html).
Since then, 11 regular Tails contributors voted on the
[[!tails_blueprint logo desc="36 proposals"]].

Winner
======

The winning proposal is the one by [[!tails_blueprint logo#tchou desc="Tchou"]].

We commented on the initial version and we already came up with an improved
version: [[!tails_blueprint logo/tchou-improved.png]]

Congratulations!

In the coming days we will keep on fine-tuning it and integrating it in time for
Tails 1.0. So don't hesitate to comment on it.
