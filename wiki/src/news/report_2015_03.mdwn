[[!meta title="Tails report for March, 2015"]]
[[!meta date="Thu, 09 Apr 2015 08:02:37 +0000"]]

March was full of surprises: first Mozilla changed the release date for Firefox, so the Tor team had to change the release date for the [[Tor Browser|https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-browser-406-released]], and we had to change the release date of version 1.3.1. Usually, these updates are a little late... but this time, it has been advanced one week earlier!

But then... a whole bunch of [[vulnerabilities were discovered in Firefox|https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/known-vulnerabilities/firefox-esr/#firefoxesr31.6]], so Mozilla did an emergency release.  Due to their early release, we released 1.3.1 early as well, so that we could incorporate those security fixes. And the planned 1.3.1 became 1.3.2. So, instead of a release-free month, we had a two-releases month!

Despite the hectic changes of plans, we did some good work. And for starters, a bit of recursivity: in March, we... published the [[two|news/report_end_of_2014]] [[previous|news/report_2015_01-02]] reports ;)

Releases
========

* [[Tails 1.3.1 was released on March 23, 2015|news/version_1.3.1]] (minor release).
* [[Tails 1.3.2 was released on March 31, 2015|news/version_1.3.2]] (minor release).
* The next release (1.4) is [[planned for May 12|https://tails.boum.org/contribute/calendar/]].

Code
====

The two releases of this month fixed security issues, but did not introduce major changes visible to the user. For details, see each release announcement.

We see a lot of users still confused with how to save files from the Tor Browser, so [[here's the link|https://tails.boum.org/doc/anonymous_internet/Tor_Browser#index1h1]] if you have the same problem :)

Documentation and website
=========================

* We explained why users [[shouldn't update Tails using `apt-get` or <span class="application">Synaptic</span>|support/faq#upgrade]].

* We explained how to [[install additional software|doc/first_steps/additional_software]].

* We mentioned I2P in our [[About page|about]].

* We explained [[what is metadata and recommend cleaning it|doc/sensitive_documents/graphics]].

* We added to the known issues that [[Tails doesn't erase the video memory|support/known_issues#video-memory]].

User experience
===============

* We did a UX sprint at [NUMA Paris](https://numa.paris/) to start our work on the [[web assistant
  for getting started with Tails|blueprint/bootstrapping/assistant]]:
  - We discussed [[two initial designs we did
    beforehand|blueprint/bootstrapping/assistant#1st_iteration]].
  - We decided on a broad structure for our work.
  - We [[refined our initial
    designs|blueprint/bootstrapping/assistant#2nd_iteration]], conducted user
    testing on each of them, [[drew conclusions from
    that|blueprint/bootstrapping/assistant#3rd_iteration]].

Infrastructure
==============

* Our test suite now covers 162 scenarios, 9 more than in February
  (but the numbers in February report were wrong). Thanks to some
  welcome refactoring, we turned 14 tests into one :)

* As [[announced recently|news/signing_key_transition]], Tails ships a new signing key in 1.3.

* We have [[!tails_ticket 6564 desc="enabled"]] core developers to
  remotely run the Tails automated test suite on our infrastructure.

* We did quite some work to prepare our infrastructure for the
  upcoming release of Debian 8 (Jessie). Not only we have started
  upgrading some of our systems, but for example, we have adapted our
  automated test suite [[!tails_ticket 8165 desc="to run in a Jessie
  environment"]], which led us to discover [[!debbug 766475 desc="a
  bug"]] in [[!debpts python-xmpp]], that we then fixed directly in
  Debian. Similarly, we have also helped validating the fix for
  a regression we have suffered from in the version of Puppet that is
  shipped in Jessie.

* Lots of thought and discussion was put into [[!tails_ticket 8654
  desc="revamping how we handle our APT repository"]].

Funding
=======

* We [[received a $25,000 donation from DuckDuckGo|https://duck.co/blog/donations_2015]]. Thank you :)

* We started integrating the feedback from [Open Technology
  Fund](https://www.opentechfund.org/) into our proposal, and answered some of
  their questions.

* We submitted our first quarterly report to the [Digital
  Defenders Partnership](https://digitaldefenders.org/).

* Our income statement for 2014 is almost ready to be published --
  stay tuned.

* We removed the call for donations from the homepage of the website,
  but... yes, you guessed, [[we still welcome your donations, in euro,
  US dollar, bitcoin, or your favorite currency|donate]] :)

Outreach
