Some of the newest contributors were particularly active this month:

  - We have a new and active maintainer for I2P in Tails. Big up to Kytv! So I2P
    was [[!tails_gitweb_branch feature/i2p-0.9.8.1 desc="updated"]] to 0.9.8.1,
    and the I2P configuration and integration was improved in several ways.
  - SCIM was
    [replaced](http://git.tails.boum.org/winterfairy/tails/log/?h=bugfix/ibus)
    by IBus as input method to better support various input methods
    (Closes [[!tails_ticket 5624]] and [[!tails_ticket 6206]]). Thanks to WinterFairy!
  - Kevin C. Krinke has been actively working on a [replacement of the
    clock](http://kevin.c.krinke.ca/builds/tailsclock) with configurable
    timezone. Many thanks!
  - A script has been written to automate the [[!tails_gitweb_branch
    feature/import-translations desc="importation process"]] of completed
    translations from Transifex. Thanks to WinterFairy!
  - The keyboard selection for some languages in Tails Greeter was
    [fixed](http://git.tails.boum.org/greeter/log/?h=bugfix/5469-default-country-and-translation)
    (Closes [[!tails_ticket 5741]]). Again thanks to WinterFairy!

We kept on working on some major features, some are about to be released:

  - The real-world deployment of incremental updates has been
    [[!tails_gitweb_branch feature/incremental-upgrades desc="made
    ready for beta testing"]] and
    will be the default way to upgrade Tails, on point-releases at least.
  - The second round of upgrade towards a safer
    persistence was [[!tails_gitweb_branch
    bugfix/safer-persistence desc="prepared"]].
  - A lot of work has been done towards [[!tails_gitweb_branch feature/spoof-mac
    desc="MAC spoofing"]]. See the latest [[blueprint|blueprint/macchanger]] of
    our design.
  - The migration to Firefox 24 and Torbutton 1.6 was completed (Closes
    [[!tails_ticket 6370]] and [[!tails_ticket 6371]]).

Regarding security:

  - The serious security upgrade to NSS 3.15.3 was prepared but we unfortunately
    didn't have time to make a point release just for that. See CVE-2013-1741,
    CVE-2013-5605 and CVE-2013-5606.
  - More IP and MAC addresses are sanitized in WhisperBack reports (Closes
    [[!tails_ticket 6391]]).

Regarding user experience:

  - DPMS screen blanking has been [[!tails_gitweb_branch bugfix/disable-dpms
    desc="disabled"]] (Closes [[!tails_ticket 5617]]).
  - The default system partition size is now [[!tails_gitweb_branch
    feature/bigger-system-partition desc="2.5GB"]].
  - The bug that prevented Vidalia to show up sometimes was
    [[!tails_gitweb_branch bugfix/vidalia_fails_to_start desc="fixed"]].

And also:

  - Tails now have its own [[!tails_gitweb
    config/chroot_local-includes/usr/local/lib/tails-shell-library
    desc="shell"]] and [perl](https://git-tails.immerda.ch/perl5lib) libraries
    where we factorize some of our code.
  - Upgrade to Linux 3.11 and got back to Linux 3.10 because 3.11 breaks the
    shutdown process on some hardware.
  - Uploaded a few packages and backports we need into Debian.
  - Tails Installer [[!tails_gitweb_branch
    bugfix/dont-fail-upgrade-if-tmp-dir-exists-on-destination
    desc="does not fail anymore"]] if the `tmp` directory exists on
    the destination filesystem.

Documentation and website
=========================

  - A [[draft FAQ|blueprint/faq]] was create to answer some questions asked on
    our previous [[forum|forum]].
  - A [[calendar|contribute/calendar]] was created to centralize all the
    important dates for the community.
  - A [[glossary|contribute/glossary]] was created on the website to define
    terms specific to our process.
  - The roles on the Contribute page were [[described|contribute]].
  - Two new contribution pages were added: [[graphics|contribute/how/graphics]]
    and [[user interface|contribute/how/user_experience]].
  - Instructions to change the persistence passphrase were
    [[!tails_gitweb_branch doc/change_persistence_passphrase desc="drafted"]].
  - The [[contribute/release_schedule]] was updated to match current
    practice more closely.
  - The [[documentation for translators|contribute/how/translate]] now
    points to Git tutorials.

Infrastructure
==============

  - We have organized donations of UEFI hardware, and purchased
    some more.
  - Recovered from disk breakage on our main server.
  - Surveyed operators of HTTP mirrors for SNI availability.
    The results look good, next step is to get a certificate for
    `dl.amnesia.boum.org`.
