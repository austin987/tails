"They are not accused of a crime but considered to be witnesses in a case: "

"During the search, computers, storage media, personal items, bank account "

"that if you have donated to Tails before October 18th 2017 using our "
"European bank account, your data is now in the hands of the German police "
"(IBAN account number, name of account holder, amount, and date). If you "
"donated after this date, you donated to our new fiscal sponsor CCT and not "
