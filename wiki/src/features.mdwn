*amnesia* is a **Live System** ([Live CD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_CD),
[Live USB](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_USB)) aimed at preserving your
privacy and anonymity. It can be used on most commonly found computers
independently of Microsoft Windows or whatever installed operating system.

Particularly, *amnesia* guarantees you that:

* All outgoing connections to the Internet are forced to go through the
  Tor network.
* No trace is left on local storage devices unless explicitely asked.
