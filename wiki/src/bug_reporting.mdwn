So you think you have found a bug in amnesia, and are willing to tell
us about it. Great. Please read-on.

Why you should read this
========================

Simply put, the more effectively you report a bug, the more likely we
are to fix it.

How to write a useful bug report
================================

Please read at least the _Summary_ section of the great
[How to Report Bugs Effectively](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html#summary)

Once you are done, you can eventually [[post|bugs]] your bug report.

Special cases
=============

amnesia does not boot entirely
------------------------------

In the graphical boot menu, press `TAB` to add the `debug` parameter
to the boot command line, and remove the `splash` one from there, so
that a bunch of hopefully useful messages are displayed on boot.

Then try to boot again, and append the end of the boot log (or what
seems to be relevant to your problem) to your bug report.
