	<p>As a consequence, <strong>they don't provide you with a

	<p><strong>All Tails ISO image are cryptographically signed by our
	OpenPGP key.</strong>
	OpenPGP is a standard for data encryption that provides cryptographic
	privacy and authentication through the use of keys owned by its users.
	Checking this signature is the recommended way of checking the ISO image
	integrity.</p>

	<p>If you already know how to use an OpenPGP key you can download it
	straight away:</p>

	<p>The Tails signing key that you downloaded from this website could

	<p>Finding a way of trusting better Tails signing key would allow you to

	<h1 class="bullet-number-four">Install or upgrade Tails</h1>

        <h2>Upgrading a Tails USB stick or SD card</h2>

	<p>If you already have a Tails device, USB stick or SD card, installed
	using <span class="application">Tails Installer</span>, then follow our
	[[upgrade instructions|doc/first_steps/upgrade]].</p>

	<h2>Installing Tails</h2>

	<p>You can either burn Tails onto a DVD or install it onto a USB stick or SD card.</p>

	<h3>Burning a DVD</h3>
	<ul>
	  <li>DVDs are read-only so your Tails can't be altered by a virus or an
	  attacker.</li>
	  <li>DVDs are cheap but you will need to burn a new DVD each time you
	  update your version of Tails.</li>
	  <li>You could also use a DVD-RW but those are not read-only.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>For detailed instructions on how to burn an ISO image under Linux,
	Windows or Mac OS X you can consult <a
	href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BurningIsoHowto">the
	corresponding Ubuntu documentation</a>: just replace the Ubuntu ISO
	image by the Tails ISO image you downloaded and ignore the part on
	verifying the data integrity since you've already done that.</p>

	<h3>Installing onto a USB stick or SD card</h3>

	<p><strong>The content of the device will be lost in the
	operation.</strong></p>

	<ul>
	  <li>An attacker with physical access to your device or through a
	  virus could alter your Tails.</li>
	  <li>USB sticks and SD cards can be upgraded to future versions of Tails.</li>
	  <li>You can use [[persistence|doc/first_steps/persistence]]
	  and store your documents and configuration in an encrypted
	  persistent volume on the same device.</li>
	  <li>USB sticks and SD cards are smaller to fit in your pocket.</li>
	  <li>Some older computers might not be able to start from a USB stick or SD card.</li>
	  <li>Some USB sticks, SD cards, or SD card adapters have a
	  read-only switch that can prevent your Tails from
	  being altered, but be aware that this protection is most probably not
	  ensured by the device itself: do not rely on untrusted computers to
	  respect this feature.</li>
	</ul>

	<strong>It's very important to keep your version of Tails up-to-date, otherwise
	your system will be vulnerable to numerous security holes.</strong> The
	development team is doing its best to release new versions fixing known
	security holes on a regular basis.
	</p>

	<p>New versions are announced on our <a
	href='https://mailman.boum.org/listinfo/amnesia-news'>news
	mailing-list</a>. Drop your email address into this box, then hit the
	button to subscribe:

	<form method="POST" action="https://mailman.boum.org/subscribe/amnesia-news">

		to the news mailing-list.
	</form>
	</p>

	<p>There also are <a href='/torrents/rss/index.rss'>RSS</a> and
	<a href='/torrents/rss/index.atom'>Atom</a> feeds that announce new
	available BitTorrent files.</p>

	<p>Refer to our [[security announcements|/security]] feed for more
	detailed information about the security holes affecting Tails.
	Furthermore you will be automatically notified of the security holes
	affecting the version you are using at the startup of a new Tails
	session.</p>

	<p>Since Tails is based on Debian, it takes advantage of all the
	work done by the Debian security team. As quoted from <a
	href="http://security.debian.org/">(http://security.debian.org/)</a>:</p>

	<blockquote>Debian takes security very seriously. We handle all
	security problems brought to our attention and ensure that they are
	corrected within a reasonable timeframe. Many advisories are coordinated
	with other free software vendors and are published the same day a
	vulnerability is made public and we also have a Security Audit team that
	reviews the archive looking for new or unfixed security bugs.
	</blockquote>

	<blockquote>Experience has shown that "security through obscurity" does
	not work. Public disclosure allows for more rapid and better solutions
	to security problems. In that vein, this page addresses Debian's status
	with respect to various known security holes, which could potentially
	affect Debian.</blockquote>

	<h1 class="bullet-number-six">Start Tails!</h1>

	<p>Now that you have a Tails device you can shutdown your
	computer and start using Tails without altering your existing operating
	system.</p>

	<p><strong>If you are using a DVD:</strong> Put the Tails DVD into the
	CD/DVD-drive and restart the computer. You should see a welcome screen
	prompting you to choose your language.</p>

	<p>If you don't get this menu, you can consult the Ubuntu documentation
	about <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootFromCD">booting
	from the CD</a> for more information, especially the part on the <a
	href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootFromCD#BIOS%20is%20not%20set%20to%20boot%20from%20CD%20or%20DVD%20drive">
	BIOS settings</a>.</p>

	<p><strong>If you are using a USB stick or SD card:</strong> Shutdown the computer,
	plug your device and start the computer. You should see a welcome
	screen prompting you to choose your language.</p>

	<p>If your computer does not automatically do so, you might need to edit
	the BIOS settings. Restart your computer, and watch for a message
	telling you which key to press to enter the BIOS setup. It will usually
	be one of F1, F2, DEL, ESC or F10. Press this key while your computer is
	booting to edit your BIOS settings. You need to edit the Boot Order.
	Depending on your computer you should see an entry for 'removable drive'
	or 'USB media'. Move this to the top of the list to force the computer
	to attempt to start from your device before starting from the internal hard disk. Save your
	changes and continue.</p>
