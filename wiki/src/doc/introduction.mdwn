[[!meta title="Introduction"]]

The goal of this documentation is to present The Amnesic Incognito Live
System (Tails) in an easy to understand and reasonably thorough manner in hope
to give the new user a crash course in what might be a completely new
set of applications and concepts regarding anonymity and security on
the Internet.

It will **not** fully document the applications included in Tails, but rather
give an overview of them and go on details only on the Tails-specific
configuration.

It is quite long so you might want to not read it in one go but
instead read [[about]] and [[about/warning]], as well as the sections
on only those applications you intend to use with the possibility to
return to it whenever you want to try something new or use it for
reference.

If you have experience with these applications and concepts from
elsewhere and feel comfortable with the user interface in general,
reading this document is maybe not necessary at all. A word of caution
to all users is not to alter the network, proxy and firewall settings
unless you know what you are doing – poking around with them too much
might spoil the built-in defences of Tails.
