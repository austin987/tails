"By relaying your Internet traffic through the Tor network (which Tails does "

"when sent between the Tor network and your destination (this is unavoidable "

"As such, if you are sending or receiving sensitive data whose disclosure "

"Also, please try to follow the instructions given by security tools as much "
"to the letter as possible. There are situations where one can be creative or "
"improvise solutions, but you should really try to learn when that is "
"appropriate before you do it. For instance, when using PGP encryption you "
"are often asked to verify the authenticity of any new public key that you "
"have just got. If you do not do this it is possible that you are using a "
"compromised key sent by an attacker performing a [man-in-the-middle attack]"
"(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_in_the_middle_attack).  Usually the "
"authentication works by presenting you with the key's so called fingerprint, "
"which is a unique identifier for that key that cannot be faked. Verification "
"should then be done by asking you friend to send you the fingerprint through "
"some safe channel, which could be anything from telling it by telephone or "
"VoiP (which is hard for an attacker to manipulate on the fly) or even face-"
"to-face (but hen you can exchange the actual keys securely instead), and "
"then making sure that they are the same. Assuming the channel is safe the "
"fingerprint sent by your friend and the one you get from the key should be "
"identical, otherwise something is wrong."

"The above authentication methods are of course not always possible, but here "
"is one of those places you can be creative. For example, you could send the "
"fingerprint hidden in an innocent looking image by some means, although this "
"is admittedly not bulletproof. You could make this method a bit safer by "
"first sending the picture to your unknowing recipient and telling him or her "
"how the fingerprint is hidden when you know that it has been received. "
"Additionally, these kinds of tricky exchanges are always better to make over "
"interactive communication channels such as IRC or with instant messaging "
"since that will decrease the window of opportunity for any eavesdropper to "
"interfere. Email is not very suitable as delays are long which gives the "
"attacker ample time to act. An alternative authentication method to "
"fingerprints, used by OTR, is to simply ask both parties of a shared secret "
"that both should know. In this case, do not choose just anything – if "
"someone is watching you they probably know which high school you went to, "
"the size of your shoes and similar facts."
