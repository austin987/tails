<p><strong><span class="application">Electrum</span> in Tails cannot connect
anymore to Electrum servers.</strong></p>

<p>The version of <span class="application">Electrum</span> in Tails is
vulnerable to a <a href="https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/issues/4968">phishing
attack that tricks people in updating to a malicious version of
<span class="application">Electrum</span></a> which is not distributed from the
official Electrum website.</p>

<p><strong>You are safe unless you try to do the malicious update
manually.</strong></p>

<p>To prevent this phishing attack, all trustworthy
<span class="application">Electrum</span> servers now prevent
older versions from connecting to them.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, newer versions of <span class="application">Electrum</span>
are not available in Debian and cannot be integrated easily in Tails. Given the
lack of maintenance of Electrum in Debian, we are still
<a href="http://lists.autistici.org/message/20190319.170700.b3b5bf1f.en.html">assessing
what is best to do in Tails</a>.</p>

<p>Until then, your wallet is not lost and you can restore it from its seed
using an <a href="https://electrum.org/#download">up-to-date version of
Electrum</a> outside of Tails.</p>
