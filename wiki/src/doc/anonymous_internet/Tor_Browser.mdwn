[[!meta title="Browsing the web with Tor Browser"]]

Tor Browser is a rebranded version of the [[Mozilla
Firefox|http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/]] web browser. Given its popularity many
of you have probably used it before and its user interface is like any other
modern web browser.

Here are a few things worth mentioning in the context of Tails.

HTTPS Encryption
================

Using HTTPS instead of HTTP encrypts your communication while browsing the web.

All the data exchanged between your browser and the server you are visiting are
encrypted. It prevents the
[[Tor exit node to eavesdrop on your communication|doc/about/warning#exit_node]].

HTTPS also includes mechanisms to authenticate the server you are communicating
with. But those mechanisms can be flawed,
[[as explained on our warning page|about/warning#man-in-the-middle]].

For example, here is how the browser looks like when we try to log in an email
account at [lavabit.com](http://lavabit.com/), using their [webmail
interface](https://lavabit.com/apps/webmail/src/login.php):

[[!img doc/anonymous_internet/Tor_Browser/lavabit.png link=no alt="Tor browser"]]

Notice the small area on the left of the address bar saying "lavabit.com" on a
blue background and the address beginning with "https://" (instead of
"http://"):

[[!img Tor_Browser/address-bar.png link=no alt="address bar showing 'lavabit.com'
/ 'https://lavabit.com/'"]]

These are the indicators that an encrypted connection using [[!wikipedia HTTPS]]
is being used.

You should try to only use services providing HTTPS when you are sending or
retrieving sensitive information (like passwords), otherwise its very easy for
an eavesdropper to steal whatever information you are sending or to modify the
content of a page on its way to your browser.

HTTPS Everywhere
================

[[!img https-everywhere.jpg link=no alt="HTTPS Everywhere logo"]]

[HTTPS Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere) is a Firefox extension
shipped in Tails and produced as a collaboration between [The Tor
Project](https://torproject.org/) and the [Electronic Frontier
Foundation](https://eff.org/). It encrypts your communications with a number of
major websites. Many sites on the web offer some limited support for encryption
over HTTPS, but make it difficult to use. For instance, they may default to
unencrypted HTTP, or fill encrypted pages with links that go back to the
unencrypted site. The HTTPS Everywhere extension fixes these problems by
rewriting all requests to these sites to HTTPS.

Torbutton
=========

Tor alone is not enough to protect your anonymity and privacy while browsing the
web.  All modern web browsers, such as Firefox, support [[!wikipedia
JavaScript]], [[!wikipedia Adobe_Flash]], [[!wikipedia HTTP_cookie
desc="cookies"]] and other services which have been shown to be able to defeat
the anonymity provided by the Tor network.

In Tails all such features are handled from inside the browser by an extension
called [Torbutton](https://www.torproject.org/torbutton/) which does all sorts
of things to prevent the above type of attacks. But that comes at a price: since
this will disable some functionalities and some sites might not work as
intended.

To learn more about Torbutton you can see:

  FAQ](https://www.torproject.org/torbutton/torbutton-faq.html.en)

Protection against dangerous JavaScript
=======================================

Having all JavaScript disabled by default would disable a lot of harmless and
possibly useful JavaScript and render unusable many websites.

That's why **JavaScript is enabled by default** in Tails.

But we rely on Torbutton to **disable all potentially dangerous JavaScript**.

We consider this as a necessary compromise between security and usability and as
of today we are not aware of any JavaScript that would compromise Tails
anonymity.

For more technical details you can refer to the [Torbutton design
document](https://www.torproject.org/torbutton/en/design/).

NoScript to have even more control over JavaScript
==================================================
