[[!meta title="Exchange bitcoins using Electrum"]]

<span class="application">Electrum</span> is a [[!wikipedia bitcoin]] client that is
particularly suited to the context of Tails because:

  - Your wallet can be recovered entirely from a passphrase, called
    *seed*. So you can use your wallet from different devices and avoid
    losing bitcoins in a backup mistake or computer failure.
  - Electrum does not download the blockchain. So there is no waiting
    time when starting.
  - You can sign transactions from an offline working session.

<div class="caution">

<p>Bitcoin is <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/faq#is-bitcoin-anonymous">not
anonymous</a>.</p>

<p>To increase privacy, remember to use a separate receiving address for
each transaction.</p>

To start <span class="application">Electrum</span> choose
<span class="menuchoice">
  <span class="guimenu">Applications</span>&nbsp;▸
  <span class="guisubmenu">Internet</span>&nbsp;▸
  <span class="guimenuitem">Electrum Bitcoin Wallet</span>
</span>.

To learn how to use *Electrum*, read the [documentation on the
*Electrum* website](https://electrum.org/).

<div class="caution">

<p>If you loose your <em>seed</em>, then you loose your entire wallet.</p>

<p>That's why we recommend that you activate the [[<span class="guilabel">Bitcoin Client</span>
persistence feature|doc/first_steps/persistence/configure/#bitcoin]] to
store your bitcoin wallet and preferences across separate working
sessions.</p>
