"The name is quite self-explanatory – this is what you should use to manage "
"your network, which usually only consists of establishing an Internet "
"connection. In many cases this is done more or less automatically. For "
"example, if you are connected with wire, NetworkManager will try to obtain "
"network access automatically. If you want to connect via wireless with a "
"supported wireless adapter, you are basically two clicks away."

"All wireless networks your computer is picking up are listed there, as\n"
"are all wired networks you have access to (usually one per wire), so\n"
"the second click is used for choosing any one of these. If the network\n"
"is protected you will be prompted for a password. There are other\n"
"options too, e.g. for dial-up connections and setting up VPNs although\n"
"these will require further set-up in the \"Options -> Configure...\"\n"
