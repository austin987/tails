Connecting to a network
=======================

You can connect to a network using a wired, Wi-Fi, or mobile broadband
connection:

1. Open the system menu in the top-right corner.

   [[!img doc/first_steps/introduction_to_gnome_and_the_tails_desktop/system.png link="no"]]

   - If a wired connection is detected, Tails automatically connects to the network.

   - To connect to a Wi-Fi network, choose <span class="guilabel">Wi-Fi Not
     Connected</span> and then <span class="guilabel">Select Network</span>.

   - To connect to a mobile broadband network, choose
     <span class="guilabel">Mobile Broadband</span>.

   <div class="note">
   <p>It is currently impossible to connect to a network using:</p>

   <ul>
   <li>Dial-up modems.</li>
   <li>VPNs, see [[the corresponding FAQ|support/faq#vpn]].</li>
   </ul>

   </div>

1. After establishing a connection to a network:

   - If you can already access the Internet, Tor is automatically started.

   - If you need to log in to a captive portal before being granted access to
     the Internet, see our documentation on [[logging in to captive
     portals|doc/anonymous_internet/unsafe_browser]].

For more information, open
<span class="application">[[GNOME Help|first_steps/introduction_to_gnome_and_the_tails_desktop#help]]</span>
and choose <span class="guilabel">Networking, web & email</span>.

If you are concerned about being identified as a Tails user on your
network, read our documentation about [[network
fingerprinting|doc/about/fingerprint]].

Troubleshooting Wi-Fi not working
=================================

[[!inline pages="doc/anonymous_internet/networkmanager/no-wifi.inline" raw="yes" sort="age"]]

* Check in our list of [[known Wi-Fi issues|support/known_issues#wi-fi-workarounds]]
  if there is a workaround to get your Wi-Fi interface to work in Tails.

Using Tor bridges or a local proxy
==================================

To connect to Tor using bridges or configure a proxy to access the Internet,
you need to [[activate additional Tor configuration when starting Tails|first_steps/startup_options#additional]].

Modifying and saving your network settings
==========================================

To modify your network settings, for example, to configure whether or not
to automatically connect to a Wi-Fi network, do the following:

1. Open the system menu in the top-right corner.

1. Click on the [[!img lib/preferences-system.png alt="System" class="symbolic" link="no"]] button to open the system settings.

1. Choose <span class="guilabel">Network</span>.

If you want to reuse your custom
configuration or the passwords of encrypted wireless connections across separate
working sessions, you can activate the [[<span class="guilabel">Network connections</span> persistence
feature|first_steps/persistence/configure#network_connections]].
