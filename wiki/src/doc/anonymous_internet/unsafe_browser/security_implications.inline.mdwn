- **The *Unsafe Browser* is not anonymous.**

  The *Unsafe Browser* does not use Tor. The websites that you visit can
  see your real IP address.

  This is why we recommend that you:

  - Only use the *Unsafe Browser* to log in to captive portals or
    [[browse trusted web pages on the local
    network|advanced_topics/lan#browser]].
  - Close the *Unsafe Browser* after logging in to the captive portal,
    to avoid using it by mistake.

- **The *Unsafe Browser* can be used to deanonymize you.**

  An attacker could exploit a security vulnerability in another
  application in Tails to start an invisible *Unsafe Browser* and reveal
  your IP address, even if you are not using the *Unsafe Browser*.

  For example, an attacker could exploit a security vulnerability in
  *Thunderbird* by sending you a [phishing
  email](https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/how-avoid-phishing-attacks) that
  could start an invisible *Unsafe Browser* and reveal them your IP
  address.

  Such an attack is very unlikely but could be performed by a strong
  attacker, such as a government or a hacking firm.

  This is why we recommend that you:

  - Only enable the *Unsafe Browser* if you need to log in to a captive
    portal.
  - Always upgrade to the latest version of Tails to fix known
    vulnerabilities as soon as possible.

  We have plans to fix the root cause of this problem but it requires
  [[!tails_ticket 12213 desc="important engineering work"]].
