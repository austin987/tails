"[I2P](https://geti2p.net/) is an alternative anonymity network to Tor which "
"supports most common Internet activities like web browsing, email, "
"filesharing etc. Unlike Tor, whose main focus arguably is on accessing sites "
"from the \"normal\" Internet, I2P is more oriented towards being a closed [[!"
"wikipedia darknet]], separate from the \"normal\" Internet. Any one running "
"I2P can run an anonymous server, a so called Eepsite, that is only "
"accessible within I2P using the `.i2p` top level domain (similar to `.onion` "
"for Tor hidden services). For instance, the I2P homepage can also be "
"accessed through I2P via <http://i2p-projekt.i2p>."

"Once started, the so called router console will open in Tor Browser, which "
"shows I2P's current status, links to many useful I2P resources (forums, "
"email, filesharing etc.) and offers the possibility to shutdown I2P. I2P is "
"integrated in the browser in such a way that all `.i2p` addresses are "
"accessed correctly through I2P while all other addresses are handled by Tor, "
"all at the same time."
