[[!meta title="Controlling Tor with Vidalia"]]

Vidalia is an anonymity manager. Basically this means that it can be used
to control Tor, and is automatically launched on network connection.

[[!toc levels=1]]

As soon as the Tor client managed to establish a route to the Tor
network, Vidalia hides as an onion icon in the notification area of
the screen.

Right-clicking this icon displays a configuration menu.

The <span class="emphasis">Network Map</span>
=============================================

The <span class="emphasis">network map</span> displays a window showing a map
of the Tor network, a list of Tor relays and a list of currently used routes
and their status.

[[!img vidalia/network_map.png link=no]]

In here, all the Tor nodes in the Tor network are listed, as are all
your circuits and connections that go through the Tor network. This
requires a bit of technical knowledge of how Tor works in order to
understand and use, but it is not at all necessary. From the
connection listing it should at least be relatively easy for you to
see which exit node and country it appears your connections come from.

The <span class="emphasis">New Identity</span> feature
======================================================

<div class="caution">

[[As explained on our warning page|about/warning#identities]], this feature of
Vidalia is not a solution to really separate different contextual identities.
<strong>Shutdown and restart Tails instead.</strong>

Connect Through a Bridge
========================

[[See the corresponding documentation.|first_steps/startup_options/bridge_mode]]

Configuring Hidden Services for Tor
===================================

Tor allows clients and relays to offer hidden services. That is, you can offer
a web server, SSH server, etc. without revealing your IP address to its users.
In fact, because you don't use any public address, you can run a hidden service
from behind a firewall.

[See the corresponding documentation from The Tor Project.](https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-hidden-service.html)
