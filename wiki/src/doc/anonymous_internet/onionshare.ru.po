"Tails includes [OnionShare](https://onionshare.org/), a tool for anonymous "
"filesharing. It allows you to share files directly from your running Tails.  "
"To do so, it creates an onion service (a website whose address ends with *."
"onion*)  within the Tor network. Any Tor user who you give this address to "
"can download the files you decided to share."
