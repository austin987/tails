[[!meta title="Use Tails"]]

In this section we will briefly present how to use Tails, and
especially the main applications included in Tails. Users are
encouraged to look for further information about them elsewhere and to
experiment (while not doing anything sensitive!) for their own
benefit. All the pictures are clickable to get them undistorted and in
full size, but note that some of the text is smudged in order to
protect identities.
