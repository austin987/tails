"The goal of this documentation is to present The Amnesic Incognito Live "

"It is quite long so you might want to not read it in one go but instead read "
"[[about]] and [[about/warning]], as well as the sections on only those "

"If you have experience with these applications and concepts from elsewhere "
"and feel comfortable with the user interface in general, reading this "
"document is maybe not necessary at all. A word of caution to all users is "
"not to alter the network, proxy and firewall settings unless you know what "
"you are doing – poking around with them too much might spoil the built-in "
"defences of Tails."
