"Starting a computer on a media containing Tails doesn't change anything on "
"the operating system actually installed on your hard drive: as a live "
"system, Tails doesn't need to use your hard drive during the whole session. "
"Be your hard drive absent or damaged, it wouldn't prevent your computer to "
"start Tails. Consequently, removing the DVD or USB stick containing Tails is "
"enough to retrieve your usual operating system."
