"Starting a computer on a media containing Tails doesn't change anything on "
"the operating system actually installed on your hard disk: as a live system, "

"hard disk absent or damaged, it wouldn't prevent your computer to start "
"Tails. Consequently, removing the DVD or USB stick containing Tails is "
"enough to retrieve your usual operating system."
