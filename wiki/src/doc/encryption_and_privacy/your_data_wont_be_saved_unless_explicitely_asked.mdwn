[[!meta title="Your data won't be saved unless explicitely asked"]]

As stated in the [[about]] page, Tails is designed to leave no trace on the
computer you're using unless you ask it explicitly. It is important
to understand some of the consequences of that.

Starting a computer on a media containing Tails doesn't change anything on the
operating system actually installed on your hard drive: as a live system, Tails
doesn't need to use your hard drive during the whole session. Be your hard drive absent
or damaged, it wouldn't prevent your computer to start Tails. Consequently,
removing the CD or USB stick containing Tails is enough to retrieve your usual
operating system.

A consequence of this amnesia is that you can't save anything on the device
containing Tails, be it files you create or download or any configuration you
might do. You should save anything you want to keep for later access into a
separate device (other USB stick, other CD or any device you would choose).
Future versions of Tails will propose a feature to save some files or
configuration, but it is still being developed.
