[[!meta title="OpenPGP Applet"]]

Tails includes a custom applet, called <span
class="application">OpenPGP Applet</span>, to manipulate text using
OpenPGP.

[[!inline pages="doc/encryption_and_privacy/gpgapplet.warning" raw="yes" sort="age"]]

<span class="application">OpenPGP Applet</span> is located in the notification area.

link=no alt=""]]

With <span class="application">OpenPGP Applet</span> you can:

  - [[Encrypt text with a passphrase|encryption_and_privacy/gpgapplet/passphrase_encryption]]
  - [[Encrypt and sign text with a public key|encryption_and_privacy/gpgapplet/public-key_cryptography]]
  - [[Decrypt and verify text|encryption_and_privacy/gpgapplet/decrypt_verify]]

Note that the applet doesn't manage your keys, that is done by Seahorse.

<div class="caution">

<p>If you have GnuPG keys stored in Persistence since before Tails 4.1
(December 2019), you should [[update your OpenPGP keyserver
configuration|doc/encryption_and_privacy/openpgp_keyserver]] to use safe
keyservers.</p>
