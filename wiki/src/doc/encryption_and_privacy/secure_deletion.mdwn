Why use secure deletion?
========================

**Operating systems do not actually remove the contents of a file when it is
deleted**, even after emptying the trash or explicitly removing the file, from
the command line for example.

Instead, they simply remove the file's entry from the file system directory,
because this requires less work and is therefore faster. The contents of the
file—the actual data—remain on the storage medium. The data will remain there
until the operating system reuses the space for new data.

Likewise, reformatting, repartitioning or reimaging a system is not always
guaranteed to write to every area of the disk, though all will cause the disk to
appear empty or, in the case of reimaging, empty except for the files present in
the image, to most software.

Finally, even when the storage medium is overwritten, physical properties of the
medium may make it possible to recover the previous contents. In most cases
however, this recovery is not possible by just reading from the storage device
in the usual way, but requires using laboratory techniques such as disassembling
the device and directly accessing/reading from its components.

Warning about USB sticks and solid-state drives
===============================================

**The methods described below will not work as expected on USB sticks and
solid-state drives.**

- The existing hard drive-oriented techniques for secure deletion of
  individual files are not effective.
- Overwriting twice the entire drive is usually, but not always,
  sufficient to securely clean the drive.

<div class="caution">

Unfortunately, Tails does not currently allow you to perform this task
with graphical tools.

Securely delete files
=====================

In Tails you can securely delete files thanks to an extension of the Nautilus
file manager called [Nautilus
Wipe](http://wipetools.tuxfamily.org/nautilus-wipe.html).

<h2 class="bullet-number-one">Select the files you want to securely delete</h2>

**Open Nautilus**, either from the **Places** menu or the **Computer** icon on
the desktop.

**Navigate to the folder** containing the files that you want to delete.

**Select the files** that you want to delete with the mouse.

[[!img select_files.png link=no alt="Three files selected in Nautilus"]]

<h2 class="bullet-number-two">Securely delete them using Nautilus Wipe</h2>

Securely delete them by doing **right-click**&nbsp;▸ **Wipe**.

[[!img wipe_files.png link=no alt="Right-click&nbsp;▸ Wipe"]]

**Confirm**.

[[!img are_you_sure_files.png link=no alt="Are you sure you want to wipe the 3
selected items?"]]

The deletion will start. It can last from a few seconds to several minutes,
according to the size of the files. Be patient…

[[!img wiping_files.png link=no alt="Wiping files…"]]

Once the deletion will be done you should be prompted with a message saying:

[[!img wipe_successful.png link=no alt="Wipe successful."]]

Securely clean available disk space
===================================

In order to clean up the contents of all files that were previously suppressed
but not securely deleted from a disk, it is also possible to securely clean all 
the free space on the disk.

<div class="caution">

This method does not work as expected on solid-state drives or USB sticks.

</div>

The disk or the folder may or may not contain other files. Those files will not
be deleted during the operation.

<h2 class="bullet-number-one">Navigate to the disk you want to securely
clean</h2>

**Open Nautilus**, either from the **Places** menu or the **Computer** icon on
the desktop.

**Navigate to a folder on the disk** that you want to clean.

<h2 class="bullet-number-two">Securely clean the available space using Nautilus
Wipe</h2>

Securely clean the available diskspace by doing **right-click**&nbsp;▸ **Wipe
available diskspace**.

[[!img wipe_available_diskspace.png link=no alt="Right-click&nbsp;▸ Wipe available
diskspace"]]

**Confirm**.

[[!img are_you_sure_diskspace.png link=no alt="Are you sure you want to wipe the
available diskspace?"]]

The cleaning will start. It can last from a few minutes to a few hours,
according to the size of the available diskspace. Be patient…

Note that a file called `oooooooo.ooo` is created in the folder. Nautilus Wipe
will try to make it as big as possible to use all the available diskspace and
then will securely delete it.

[[!img wiping_diskspace.png link=no "Wiping available diskspace…"]]

Once the cleaning will be done you should be prompted with a message saying:

[[!img wipe_successful_diskspace.png link=no "Wipe successful"]]
