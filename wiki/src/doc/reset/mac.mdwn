Format using the command line
-----------------------------

<!-- Note for translators: This section is very similar to /install/mac/usb. -->

1. Unplug the USB stick from the computer.

1. Open <span class="application">Terminal</span> from
   <span class="menuchoice">
     <span class="guimenu">Applications</span>&nbsp;▸
     <span class="guisubmenu">Utilities</span>&nbsp;▸
     <span class="guimenuitem">Terminal.app</span></span>.

1. Execute the following command:

       diskutil list

   It returns a list of the storage devices on the system. For example:

       $ diskutil list
       /dev/disk0
         #:                     TYPE NAME         SIZE      IDENTIFIER
         0:    GUID_partition_scheme             *500.1 GB  disk0
         1:                      EFI              209.7 MB  disk0s1
         2:                Apple_HFS MacDrive     250.0 GB  disk0s2
         3:                      EFI              134.1 GB  disk0s3
         4:     Microsoft Basic Data BOOTCAMP     115.5 GB  disk0s4

1. Plug the USB stick in the computer.

1. Execute again the same command:

       diskutil list

   Your USB stick appears as a new device in the list. Check
   that its size corresponds to the size of your USB stick.

       $ diskutil list
       /dev/disk0
         #:                     TYPE NAME         SIZE      IDENTIFIER
         0:    GUID_partition_scheme             *500.1 GB  disk0
         1:                      EFI              209.7 MB  disk0s1
         2:                Apple_HFS MacDrive     250.0 GB  disk0s2
         3:                      EFI              134.1 GB  disk0s3
         4:     Microsoft Basic Data BOOTCAMP     115.5 GB  disk0s4
       /dev/disk1
         #:                     TYPE NAME         SIZE      IDENTIFIER
         0:   FDisk_partition_scheme             *8.0 GB    disk1
         1:                Apple_HFS Untitled 1   8.0 GB    disk1s1

1. Take note of the *device name* of your USB stick.
   In this example, the USB stick is 8.0 GB and its device name is <span class="code">/dev/disk1</span>.
   Yours might be different.

   <div class="caution">
   <p>If you are unsure about the device name, you should stop proceeding or
   <strong>you risk overwriting any hard disk on the system</strong>.</p>
   </div>

1. Execute the following command to safely remove the USB stick. Replace <span class="code">[device]</span>
   with the device name found in step 6.

       diskutil unmountDisk [device]

2. Execute the following command to format the USB stick. Replace <span class="code">[device]</span>
   with the device name found in step 6.

       sudo fdisk -iy [device]

1. You can try to reset the USB stick again using
   <span class="application">Disk Utility</span> from the beginning of this
   page.
