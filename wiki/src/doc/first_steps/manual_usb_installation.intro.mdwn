It is recommended to use the
<span class="application">[[Tails USB installer|usb_installation]]</span> to install
Tails onto a USB stick. But you might need to use this technique to get a first
running Tails, and be able to use the
<span class="application">Tails USB installer</span> on a second USB stick.

**This technique does not allow you to set up a persistent volume.**
