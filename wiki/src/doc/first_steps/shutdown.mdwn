[[!meta title="Shutting down Tails"]]

There are several ways of shutting down Tails:

- By clicking on the system menu located in
  the upper right corner of the screen and choosing either:

  - [[!img lib/system-shutdown.png link="no" class="symbolic" alt="Shutdown icon"]] to
    shutdown the computer or
  - [[!img lib/view-refresh.png link="no" class="symbolic" alt="Restart icon"]] to restart
    the computer.

- By physically removing the USB stick or DVD that Tails is running from.

  <div class="caution">

  <p>Only physically remove the USB stick in case of emergency as doing
  so can sometimes break the file system of the Persistent Storage.</p>

  <p>If you cannot unlock the Persistent Storage anymore after
  physically removing the USB stick, try to do a [[file system check on
  the Persistent Storage|advanced_topics/persistence/check_file_system]]
  to fix it.</p>

  </div>

When you shut down Tails, all the data stored in [[!wikipedia
Random-access_memory desc="RAM"]] is erased
to protect you from [[cold boot
attacks|doc/advanced_topics/cold_boot_attacks]].
