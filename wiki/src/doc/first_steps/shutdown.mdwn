[[!meta title="Shutting down Tails"]]

There are several ways of shutting down Tails:

- By clicking on the system menu located in
  the upper right corner of the screen and choosing either:

  - [[!img lib/system-shutdown.png link="no" class="symbolic" alt="Shutdown icon"]] to
    shutdown the computer or
  - [[!img lib/view-refresh.png link="no" class="symbolic" alt="Restart icon"]] to restart
    the computer.

- By physically removing the USB stick or DVD that Tails is running from.

<div class="caution">

<p>This method might in rare occasions break the file system of your persistent
volume. <strong>Use this method only in case of emergency.</strong></p>

<p>If you cannot enable persistence after using this method, you should be able
to recover most of your data by doing a [[file system check on the persistent
volume|persistence/check_file_system]].</p>

While shutting down, the data stored in <span class="definition">[[!wikipedia

to protect from [[cold boot
