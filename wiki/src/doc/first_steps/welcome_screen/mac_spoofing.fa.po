"Every network interface — wired or Wi-Fi — has a [[!wikipedia MAC address]], "
"which is a serial number assigned to each interface at the factory by the "
"vendor. MAC addresses are used on the local network to identify the "

"While your IP address identifies where you are on the Internet, your MAC "
"address identifies which device you are using on the local network. MAC "

"1. If you use your laptop to connect to several Wi-Fi networks, the\n"

"1. Unless you choose to [[hide that you are connecting to the Tor\n"

"When MAC address anonymization is enabled, Tails temporarily changes the MAC "

"MAC address anonymization is enabled by default in Tails because it is "
