<div class="bug">

<strong>The following instructions do not work on Windows XP.</strong><br/>
The version of <span class="application">Diskpart</span> on Windows XP does not list removable disks.

</div>

Using <span class="application">Diskpart</span>
===============================================

<div class="caution">

<strong>You might overwrite any hard drive on the computer.</strong><br/>
If at some point you are not sure about the disk number, stop proceeding.

1.  Make sure that the USB stick or SD card that you want to reset is unplugged.

1.  Click on the <span class="button">Start</span> button, and choose <span
    class="menuchoice">All Programs&nbsp;▸ Accessories&nbsp;▸ Command
    Prompt</span>, to open the <span class="application">[[!wikipedia Command
    Prompt]]</span>,

    [[More help on how to start the <span class="application">Command
    Prompt</span>|http://www.computerhope.com/issues/chdos.htm]]

2.  Execute the <span class="command">diskpart</span> command, to start
<span class="application">Diskpart</span>.

3.  Execute the <span class="command">list disk</span> command to obtain
    information about each disk in the computer.

    For example:

        Diskpart> list disk

          Disk ###  Status      Size     Free     Dyn  Gpt
          --------  ----------  -------  -------  ---  ---
          Disk 0    Online        80 GB      0 B

4. Plug the USB stick or SD card that you want to reset. Run the <span
   class="command">list disk</span> command again.

   A new disk, which corresponds to that device, appears in the list.

   For example:

        Diskpart> list disk

          Disk ###  Status      Size     Free     Dyn  Gpt
          --------  ----------  -------  -------  ---  ---
          Disk 0    Online        80 GB      0 B
          Disk 1    Online         4 GB      0 B

   Make sure that its size corresponds to the size of the device that you want to
   reset. Note down the disk number assigned by <span
   class="application">Diskpart</span> to the device.

5. To select the device, execute the following command: <span
   class="command">select disk=<span class="replaceable">number</span></span>.
   Replace <span class="replaceable">number</span> by the disk number of the
   device that you want to reset.

6. Execute the <span class="command">clean</span> command to delete the
   partition table from the device.

7. Execute the <span class="command">convert mbr</span> command to
   create a new partition table on the device.

8. Execute the <span class="command">create partition primary</span>
   command to create a new primary partition on the device.
