[[!meta title="Upgrading a Tails USB Stick"]]

<span class="application">Tails USB installer</span> also allows you to upgrade
a USB stick to a newer version of Tails.

The following techniques only work if the USB stick was installed using
<span class="application">Tails USB installer</span>. **The persistent storage
on the USB stick will be preserved.** There are two methods to do the upgrade:

  - [[Upgrade by cloning from another USB stick|usb_upgrade#clone]] which already
    runs a newer version of Tails
  - [[Upgrade from an ISO image|usb_upgrade#from_iso]] of a newer version of
    Tails

As for the installation, you need to start
<span class="application">Tails USB installer</span> from another media than the
USB stick that you want to upgrade.
