[[!meta title="Manually installing onto a USB stick, for Linux"]]

This technique uses the command line.

[[!toc levels=1]]

<h2 class="bullet-number-one">Install isohybrid</h2>

Under Debian or Ubuntu the `isohybrid` utility is included in the `syslinux`
package. You can execute the following command:

    apt-get install syslinux

<a id="step_2"></a>

<h2 class="bullet-number-two">Find out the device name of the USB stick</h2>

**Warning!** If you are not sure about the device name, you should not
proceed or **you risk overwriting any hard drive on the system**.

The device name should be something like `/dev/sdb`, `/dev/sdc`, etc.

If you're not sure about the precise device name, do the following.

Unplug the USB stick.

Open the Gnome disk utility from the menu *Applications* → *System Tools* →
*Disk Utility*:

[[!img gnome_disk_utility.png link=no alt="Applications → System Tools → Disk Utility"]]

The disk utility will list all the current storage devices on the left side of
the screen:

[[!img storage_devices.png link=no alt="Storage devices, including USB peripherals"]]

Plug back the USB stick. A new device should appear in the list of
storage devices. Select it with the cursor:

[[!img destination_device.png link=no alt="A new storage device appeared at the end of the list"]]

Check that the description of the device corresponds to your USB
stick, its brand, its size, etc. on the right side of the screen.

[[!img destination_device_description.png link=no alt="Drive description containing: 'Device: /dev/sdc'"]]

On this screenshot, the USB stick is a Kingston DataTraveler of 2.0
GB and its device name is `/dev/sdc`. Yours could be different.

<h2 class="bullet-number-three">Do the copy from the terminal</h2>

Open a terminal from the menu *Applications* → *Accessories* → *Terminal* and
execute the following command, replacing `[tails.iso]` by the path to the ISO
image that you want to copy and `[device]` by the device name found in [[step
2|linux#step_2]].

    isohybrid [tails.iso] --entry 4 --type 0x1c
    cat [tails.iso] > [device] && sync

If you are not sure about the path to the ISO image or if you get a "No such
file or directory" error, you can first type `cat`, followed by a space, and
then drag and drop the icon of the ISO image from a file browser onto the
terminal. This should insert the correct path to the ISO image in the terminal.
Then complete the command.

Here is an example of the command to execute, yours might be different:

    isohybrid '/home/amnesia/Desktop/tails-0.6.2.iso' --entry 4 --type 0x1c
    cat '/home/amnesia/Desktop/tails-0.6.2.iso' > /dev/sdc && sync

After that, if you don't see any error message, Tails is being copied
onto the key. The whole process might take some time, generally a few
minutes. Be patient…

<div class="next">
<p>Once the command prompt reappears, you can
[[start Tails|/download/#start]] from this new USB stick.</p>
</div>

Troubleshooting
===============

### cat: /dev/sdx: No such file or directory

Then double-check the name of the device you found in [[step
2|linux#step_2]].

### cat: /dev/sdx: Permission denied

You might also have committed a mistake in the device name, so please
double-check it. If you're sure about the device name, this could be a
permission problem and you could need to gain administration privileges before running the
commands in the terminal. That could be:

    sudo su -
    isohybrid [tails.iso] --entry 4 --type 0x1c
    cat [tails.iso] > [device] && sync

### cat: tails.iso: No such file or directory

Then you surely have committed a mistake on the path to the ISO image in [[step
3|linux#step_3]].
