"Every network interface — wired or Wi-Fi — has a [[!wikipedia MAC address]] "
"which is a serial number defined for each interface from factory by its "
"vendor. MAC addresses are used on the local network to identify the "
"communications of each network interface."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"While your IP address identifies where you are on the Internet, your MAC "
"address identifies which device you are using on the local network. MAC "
"addresses are only useful on the local network and are not sent over the "
"Internet."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"Having such a unique identifier used on the local network can harm your "
"privacy.  Here are two examples:"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text

msgid ""
"1. If you use your laptop to connect to several Wi-Fi networks, the\n"
"same MAC address of your Wi-Fi interface is used on all those local networks. Someone\n"
"observing those networks can recognize your MAC address and **track your\n"
"geographical location**.\n"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text

"2. As explained in our documentation on [[network\n"
"fingerprint|about/fingerprint]], someone observing the traffic coming out of\n"
"your computer on the local network can probably see that you are using Tails. In\n"
"that case, your MAC address can **identify you as a Tails user**.\n"

msgid "What is MAC address spoofing?\n"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"Tails can temporarily change the MAC address of your network interfaces to "
"random values for the time of a working session. This is what we call \"MAC "
"address spoofing\". MAC address spoofing in Tails hides the serial number of "
"your network interface, and so to some extend, who you are, to the local "
"network."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"MAC address spoofing is enabled by default in Tails because it is usually "
"beneficial. But in some situations it might also lead to connectivity "
"problems or make your network activity look suspicious. This documentation "

"**Using your own computer on an public network without registration**, for "

"**Using your own computer on a network that you use frequently**, for "

"On some network interfaces, **MAC address spoofing is impossible** due to "
