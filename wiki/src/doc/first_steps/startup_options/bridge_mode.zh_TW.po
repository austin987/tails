"The less publicly known the bridges are, the better.  Unfortunately, since "

"   So the best is if you can find a trusted friend or\n"
"   an organisation in a different country who runs a \"private\" "
"*obfuscated\n"
"   bridge* for you. In this case \"private\" means that the bridge is\n"
"   configured with the option `PublishServerDescriptor 0`. Without this "
"option The Tor\n"
"   Project will learn about the bridge and may distribute its address to "
"others\n"

"   選項 為`PublishServerDescriptor 0` 。若沒有這個選項 Tor\n"
"   專案會知道這個橋接，然後可能把它的地址散佈給其它人\n"
"   這樣它最後可能會落入你敵人的手上。\n"
