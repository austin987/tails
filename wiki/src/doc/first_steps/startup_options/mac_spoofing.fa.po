"Every network interface — wired or Wi-Fi — has a [[!wikipedia MAC address]] "
"which is a serial number defined for each interface from factory by its "
"vendor. MAC addresses are used on the local network to identify the "
"communications of each network interface."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"While your IP address identifies where you are on the Internet, your MAC "
"address identifies which device you are using on the local network. MAC "
"addresses are only useful on the local network and are not sent over the "
"Internet."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"Having such a unique identifier used on the local network can harm your "
"privacy.  Here are two examples:"

#. type: Plain text
#, no-wrap
msgid ""
"1. If you use your laptop to connect to several Wi-Fi networks, the\n"
"same MAC address of your Wi-Fi interface is used on all those local networks. Someone\n"
"observing those networks can recognize your MAC address and **track your\n"
"geographical location**.\n"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#, no-wrap
msgid ""
"2. As explained in our documentation on [[network\n"
"fingerprint|about/fingerprint]], someone observing the traffic coming out of\n"
"your computer on the local network can probably see that you are using Tails. In\n"
"that case, your MAC address can **identify you as a Tails user**.\n"

msgid "What is MAC address spoofing?\n"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"Tails can temporarily change the MAC address of your network interfaces to "
"random values for the time of a working session. This is what we call \"MAC "
"address spoofing\". MAC address spoofing in Tails hides the serial number of "
"your network interface, and so to some extend, who you are, to the local "
"network."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"MAC address spoofing is enabled by default in Tails because it is usually "
"beneficial. But in some situations it might also lead to connectivity "
"problems or make your network activity look suspicious. This documentation "
"explains whether to use MAC spoofing or not, depending on your situation."

"**Using your own computer on an public network without registration**, for "

msgid ""
"**Using your own computer on a network that you use frequently**, for "
"example at a friend's place, at work, at university, etc. You already have a "

"also hides the fact that *you* are running Tails on this network."

"In some situations MAC address spoofing is not useful but can instead be "

"**Using a public computer**, for example in an Internet café or a library.  "
"This computer is regularly used on this local network, and its MAC address "
"is not associated with your identity. In this case, MAC address spoofing can "

"network."

"On some network interfaces, **MAC address spoofing is impossible** due to "
"limitations in the hardware or in Linux. Tails temporarily disables such "

"Some networks **only allow connections from a list of authorized MAC "

"**Using your own computer at home**. Your identity and the MAC address of "
