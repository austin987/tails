If you are using a computer in public you may want to avoid attracting
unwanted attention by changing the way Tails looks into something that
resembles Microsoft Windows XP.

This is currently an experimental feature that can be enabled by
adding "winxp" to the kernel cmdline: when Tails boots, select
language in the boot menu but press TAB instead of ENTER. Then write
"winxp" (without quotes) and press ENTER.

This is how your Tails desktop will look like:
