If you are using a computer in public you may want to avoid attracting
unwanted attention by changing the way Tails looks into something that
resembles Microsoft Windows XP.

Activate the Windows camouflage
===============================

The Windows camouflage can be activated from [[<span class="application">Tails
Greeter</span>|startup_options#tails_greeter]]:

1. When <span class="application">Tails Greeter</span> appears, in the
   <span class="guilabel">Welcome to Tails</span> window, click on the
   <span class="button">Yes</span> button. Then click on the
   <span class="button">Forward</span> button.

2. In the <span class="guilabel">Windows camouflage</span> section, select the
   <span class="guilabel">Activate Microsoft Windows XP Camouflage</span>
   option.

This is how your Tails desktop will look like:
