[[!meta title="Administration password"]]

In Tails, an administration password is required to perform system
administration tasks.<br/>
For example:

  - To [[install additional software|doc/advanced_topics/additional_software]]
  - To [[access the internal hard disks of the computer|doc/encryption_and_privacy/your_data_wont_be_saved_unless_explicitly_asked]]
  - To execute commands with <span class="command">sudo</span>

**By default, the administration password is disabled for better security.**
This can prevent an attacker with physical or remote access to your Tails system
to gain administration privileges and perform administration tasks
against your will.

Set up an administration password
=================================

In order to perform administration tasks, you need to set up an administration
password when starting Tails, using [[<span class="application">Tails
Greeter</span>|startup_options#tails_greeter]].

1. When <span class="application">Tails Greeter</span> appears, click on the
   <span class="button">[[!img lib/list-add.png alt="Expand" class="symbolic" link="no"]]</span> button.

   [[!img additional.png link="no" alt="Additional settings of Tails Greeter"]]

2. When the <span class="guilabel">Additional Settings</span> dialog appears,
   click on <span class="guilabel">Administration Password</span>.

3. Specify a password of your choice in both the
   <span class="guilabel">Administration Password</span> and
   <span class="guilabel">Confirm</span> text boxes then click
   <span class="button">Add</span>.
