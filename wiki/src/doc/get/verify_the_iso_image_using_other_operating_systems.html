<p>GnuPG, a common free software implementation of OpenPGP has versions
and graphical frontends for both Windows and Mac OS X. This also make it
possible to check the cryptographic signature with those operating
systems:</p>

<ul>
  <li>[[Gpg4win|http://www.gpg4win.org/]], for Windows</li>
  <li>[[GPGTools|http://www.gpgtools.org/]], for Mac OS X</li>
</ul>

<p>You will find on either of those websites detailed documentation on
how to install and use them.</p>

<h3 id="windows">For Windows using Gpg4win</h3>

<p>After installing Gpg4win, download Tails signing key:</p>

[[!inline pages="lib/download_tails_signing_key" raw="yes"]]

<p>[[Consult the Gpg4win documentation to import
it|http://www.gpg4win.org/doc/en/gpg4win-compendium_15.html]]</p>

<p>Then, download the cryptographic signature corresponding to the ISO
image you want to verify:</p>

[[!inline pages="lib/download_stable_i386_iso_sig" raw="yes"]]

<p>[[Consult the Gpg4win documentation to check the
signature|http://www.gpg4win.org/doc/en/gpg4win-compendium_24.html#id4]]</p>

<p>If you see the following warning:</p>

<a id="warning"></a>

<pre>
Not enough information to check the signature validity.
Signed on ... by tails@boum.org (Key ID: 0xBE2CD9C1
The validity of the signature cannot be verified.
</pre>

<p>Then the ISO image is still correct, and valid according to the Tails signing
key that you downloaded. This warning is related to the trust that you put in
the Tails signing key. See, [[Trusting Tails signing
key|doc/get/trusting_tails_signing_key]]. To remove this warning you would have
to personally <span class="definition">[[!wikipedia Keysigning
desc="sign"]]</span> the Tails signing key with your own key.</p>

<h3 id="mac">For Mac OS X using GPGTools</h3>

<p>After installing GPGTools, you should be able to follow the instruction for
[[Linux with the command line|verify_the_iso_image_using_the_command_line]]. To
open the command line, navigate to your Applications folder, open Utilities, and
double click on Terminal.</p>
