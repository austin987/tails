Sometimes, after an automatic upgrade, your Tails USB stick might either:

- Fail to start, often after the message:

  <pre>Loading, please wait...</pre>

- Behave weirdly. For example, your keyboard does not work or you cannot
  connect to a network.

To fix this problem, please try to do a [[manual upgrade|upgrade#manual]].

<div class="note">

<p>The persistent storage on the USB stick will be preserved.</p>
