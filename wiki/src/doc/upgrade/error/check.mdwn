[[!meta title="Error while checking for upgrades"]]

Tails could not determine whether an upgrade is available from our website.

This is most likely caused by a network connection problem.

Check your network connection and restart Tails to check for upgrades again.

If the problem persists, you can either:

- [[Report an error|support]]

  Include in your report the debugging information that appears in the error message.

- [[Do a manual upgrade|doc/upgrade#manual]]
