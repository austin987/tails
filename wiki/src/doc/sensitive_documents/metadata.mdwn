<p>Most files contain metadata which is information characterizing the
content of the file. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cameras record data about when and where a picture was taken and what
camera was used.</li>
<li>Office documents automatically add author
and company information to texts and spreadsheets.</li>
</ul>

<p>Use <span
class="application"><a href="https://0xacab.org/jvoisin/mat2">MAT</a></span> to
clean the metadata from your files before publishing or sharing:</p>

<ol>
<li>Open the <span class="application">Files</span> browser.</li>
<li>Navigate to the folder containing the files that you want to clean.</li>
<li>Select the files that you want to clean.</li>
<li>Right-click (on Mac, click with two fingers) on the files and choose
<strong>Remove metadata</strong>.</li>
</ol>
