Acknowledgements
================

  - Tails could not exist without [[Debian|https://www.debian.org/]],
    [[Debian Live|https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-live/]], and
    [[Tor|https://www.torproject.org/]]; see our
    [[contribute/relationship with upstream]] document for details.
  - Tails was inspired by the [[Incognito
    LiveCD|http://web.archive.org/web/20090220133020/http://anonymityanywhere.com/]]. The
    Incognito author declared it to be dead on March 23rd, 2010, and
    wrote that Tails "should be considered as its spiritual
    successor".
  - The [[Privatix Live-System|http://mandalka.name/privatix/]] was an
    early source of inspiration, too.
  - Some ideas (in particular
    [[tordate|contribute/design/Time_syncing]] and improvements to our
    [[contribute/design/memory_erasure]] procedure) were borrowed from
    [Liberté Linux](http://dee.su/liberte).
