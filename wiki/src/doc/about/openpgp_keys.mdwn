[[!meta title="OpenPGP keys"]]

Tails developers maintain several OpenPGP key pairs.

<div class="caution">

<p>Make sure to verify the keys that you download, because there are
several fake and maybe malicious Tails keys on the key servers.</p>

<p>For example, if you first [[authenticate the Tails signing key
through the OpenPGP Web of Trust|install/download#wot]], then
you can verify our others keys as they are all certified by the Tails
signing key.</p>

Private mailing list key
========================

Purpose
-------

### Encryption

This key has an encryption subkey. Please use it to encrypt email sent
to the core developers encrypted mailing list: [[tails@boum.org|about/contact#tails]].

Policy
------

The secret key material and its passphrase are stored on the server
that runs our encrypted mailing list software and on systems managed
by core Tails developers.

This means people other than Tails developers are in a position to
use this secret key. Tails developers trust these people enough to
rely on them for running our encrypted mailing list, but still: this
key pair is managed in a less safe way than our signing key.

How to get the public key?
--------------------------

There are multiple ways to get this OpenPGP public key:

- download it from this website: [[!tails_website tails-email.key]]
- fetch it from your favourite keyserver
- send an email to <tails-sendkey@boum.org>.

<a id="signing"></a>

Signing key
===========

Purpose
-------

This key only has the capability to sign and certify: it has no
encryption subkey.

Its only purpose is:

- to sign Tails released images;
- to certify other cryptographic public keys needed for Tails
  development.

Policy
------

The secret key material will never be stored on an online server or on
systems managed by anyone other than Tails core developers.

### Primary key

* Is not owned in a usable format by any single individual. It is
  split cryptographically using
  [gfshare](http://www.digital-scurf.org/software/libgfshare).
* Is only used offline, in an air-gapped Tails only communicating with
  the outside world through:
  - Plugging the Tails flash media in another operating system to install Tails
    in the first place.
  - Plugging other removable media in the air-gapped Tails to send the
    public key, secret key stubs, parts of the secret master key, and so on
    to the outside world.
  - Plugging other removable media in the air-gapped Tails to receive Debian
    packages, public keys, and so on from the outside world.
* Expires in less than one year. We will extend its validity as many
  times as we find reasonable.
* Has a revocation certificate split amongst different people.
  See the [[details of the mechanism|signing_key_revocation]].

### Signing subkeys

* Stored on OpenPGP smartcards owned by those who need them.
  Smartcards ensure that the cryptographic operations are done on the
  smartcard itself and that the secret cryptographic material is not
  directly available to the operating system using it.
* Expiration date: same as the primary key.
