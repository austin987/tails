[[!meta title="About Tails anonymity"]]

# <a name="why"></a>Why do you need anonymity?

As you are probably aware of, we currently find ourselves in a state of
steady decline of our freedoms and privacy, with increasing levels of
mass surveillance and repression all over the world (see [this report
from Privacy
International](http://www.privacyinternational.org/article.shtml?cmd%5B347%5D=x-347-559597)).

Without taking any precautions, your Internet service provider, the
State, the police and global surveillance systems like
[ECHELON](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECHELON) (which is _not_ a
conspiracy theory; see [this report from the European
Parliament](http://www.fas.org/irp/program/process/rapport_echelon_en.pdf))
can record what you do online: what you read, what you write and who
you communicate with.

This is possible since all messages sent over
the Internet contain the [IP
addresses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ip_address) of both the sender
and receiver, much like an ordinary mail sent through the postal
system contains addresses of both sender and receiver for two-ways
communication. IP addresses can easily be traced back to the physical
location of the computers and their owners, and from that ultimately
back to you.

If you do not mind this fact, then more power to you, but if you do
mind, then Tails might be just what you need.

Moreover, just like with a postcard, any information traveling on the
Internet can be read by many computers that relay them.

# <a name="how"></a>How does Tails provide with anonymity?

**FIXME**: This still needs to be rescued somewhere:

Furthermore, most software bundled with Tails will warn you when
your previously encrypted connection switches to unencrypted mode: be
careful!

At last, some applications have features and services that may
compromise the anonymity offered by the Tor network. All modern web
browsers, such as Firefox, support
[JavaScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javascript), [Adobe
Flash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_flash),
[Cookies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie) and other services
which have been shown to be able to defeat the anonymity provided by
the Tor network.

When running Iceweasel (Firefox) in Tails all such features are
handled by an extension called
[Torbutton](https://www.torproject.org/torbutton/) which does all
sorts of things to prevent the above type of attacks. But that comes
at a price – since this will disable some functionalitys, some sites
might not work as intended.
