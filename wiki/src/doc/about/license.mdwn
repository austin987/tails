Distribution of the source code
===============================

Most of the software distributed with Tails is taken directly from
upstream Debian packages, and is not modified or recompiled by
Tails. Software that is modified or recompiled by Tails are available
on [[our git repositories|/contribute/git]]. If you require or desire
the sources for unmodified Debian upstream packages, retrieving them
from Debian is the simplest solution to all parties (packages that can
not be found in the regular Debian archive anymore can be found at
<http://snapshot.debian.org/>).

According to the GPL licence (section 3(b) of the GPLv2 and section
6(b) of the GPLv3), complete sources for all Tails releases are
available for anyone who requests them, in DVD format, via postal
mail, for a nominal charge. If you only require one or two source
packages, Tails can work with you to send a copy of individual
packages electronically.
