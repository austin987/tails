"We want to enforce good security by default for our users. That is why it is "
"a fundamental assumption of Tails to force all outgoing traffic to anonymity "
"networks such as Tor."

"Over the years Tor has become a big network with a lot of capacity and a "
"good speed."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) could be faster than Tor but they are not "
"anonymity networks, because the administrators of the VPN can know both "
"where you are connecting from and where you are connecting to and break your "
"anonymity. Tor provides anonymity by making it impossible for a single point "
"in the network to know both the origin and the destination of a connection."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"When using a VPN, an attacker can also break your anonymity by monitoring "
"the incoming and outgoing connections of the few servers of the VPN. On the "
"other hand, the Tor network is formed by over 6000 relays run worldwide by "
"volunteers."

msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"Tor is the anonymity network with the largest user base. More than "
"2&thinsp;000&thinsp;000 users connected to Tor daily in 2019. Being adopted by such a "
"large audience proves its maturity, stability, and usability."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text

"Tor is being used equally by journalists, law enforcement, governments, "
"human rights activists, business leaders, militaries, abuse victims and "
"average citizens concerned about online privacy. This diversity actually "
"provides stronger anonymity to everyone as it makes it more difficult to "
"identify or target a specific profile of Tor user. Anonymity loves company."
