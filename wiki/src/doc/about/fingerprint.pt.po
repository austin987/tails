"[[As explained on our warning page|warning#fingerprint]], when using Tails "
"it is possible to know that you are using Tor. But Tails tries to **make it "
"as difficult as possible to distinguish Tails users from other Tor users**, "
"especially Tor Browser Bundle (TBB) users. If it is possible to determine "
"whether your are a Tails users or a TBB user, this provides more information "
"about you and in consequence reduces your anonymity."

"A Tails system is **almost exclusively generating Tor activity** on the "
"network. Usually TBB users also have network activity outside of Tor, either "
"from another web browser or other applications. So the proportion of Tor "
"activity could be used to determine whether a user is using Tails or the "
"TBB. If you are sharing your Internet connection with other users that are "
"not using Tails it is probably harder for your ISP to determine whether a "
"single user is generating only Tor traffic and so maybe using Tails."

"Tails **do not use the entry guards mechanism of Tor**. With the [entry "
"guard mechanism](https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq#EntryGuards), a Tor "
"user always uses the same few relays as first hops. As Tails does not store "
"any Tor information between separate working sessions, it does not store the "
"entry guards information either. This behaviour could be used to distinguish "
"Tails users from TBB users across several working sessions."

"When starting, Tails synchronizes the system clock to make sure it is "
"accurate. While doing this, if the time is set too much in the past or in "
"the future, Tor is shut down and started again. This behavior could be used "
"to distinguish Tails from TBB users, especially this happens every time "
"Tails starts."
