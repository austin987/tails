"The term \"local network\" here refers to the set of computers and devices "
"that can be reached directly from your computer without going through the "
"Internet. For example, your home router, your network printer, or the "
"intranet of your company are most likely on your local network, also called "
"LAN for Local Area Network. In technical terms, this refers to the set of IP "
"addresses defined in [RFC1918](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918)."
