[[!meta title="GNOME Boxes"]]

<span class="application">GNOME Boxes</span> aims at providing a simple
interface to create and use virtual machines for Linux with GNOME.
*GNOME Boxes* does not allow to use a persistent volume.

<div class="note">

<p>In Debian Wheezy, Ubuntu 14.04, and earlier,
<span class="application">GNOME Boxes</span> allocates only 512 MiB of
RAM to new virtual machines by default. This is too little to allow
Tails to run smoothly. We recommend you to reconfigure the virtual
machine and allocate at least 1 GiB of RAM.</p>

</div>

Running Tails from an ISO image
===============================

  1. Start *GNOME Boxes*.
  2. Click on the **New** button on the top of the window.
  3. In the **Source Selection** dialog, choose **Select a file** and
     browse for the ISO image that you want to start from.
  4. In the **Review** dialog, click on the **Create** button on the top
     of the window.

Shared clipboard
================

<div class="caution">

<p>The shared clipboard of <span class="application">GNOME Boxes</span>
is enabled by default. This can allow sensitive data to be copied by
mistake from the virtual machine onto the host operating system or vice
versa.</p>

<p>We recommend you to disable the shared clipboard.</p>

</div>

To disable the shared clipboard:

  1. Click on the
     [[!img preferences-system-symbolic.png alt="Preferences" class=symbolic link=no]]
     button on the top-right corner of the window.
  2. Select the **Display** screen in the left pane.
  3. Deactivate **Share clipboard** in the right pane.
  4. Click on the
     [[!img go-previous-symbolic.png alt="Previous" class=symbolic link=no]]
     button to go back to the display of the virtual machine.
