<div id="intro">

<p> Feel free to post your ideas for todo and [[wishlist]] items here.
If it seems more like a bug in the existing code, post it to [[bugs]]
instead.</p>

<p>Notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>The [[contribute/roadmap]] should help to understand our priorities.</li>
<li>Newcomers wanting to get involved should start with the
  [[how to contribute|contribute]] documentation.</li>
<li>Todo items that are fixed in Tails [[development branch|contribute/git]] and
  will therefore be solved in the next stable release appear on the
  [[list of pending todo items|todo/pending]].</li>
<li>Todo items that have been solved in a shipped release appear on
  the [[list of resolved todo items|todo/done]].</li>
</ul>
