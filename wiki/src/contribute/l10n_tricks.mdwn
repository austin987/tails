Compare the content of two PO files
===================================

Here is how to check out the differences between two PO files without
caring about strings order, line breaks or comments.

    diff -u <(msgfmt -o - translation/es/es.po | msgunfmt) \
            <(msgfmt -o - persistence-setup/po/es.po | msgunfmt)

The syntax is bash specific. Replace the paths to the two PO files you
are interested in comparing.

Calculate statistics on the translations
========================================

Run the [[language statistics.sh]] script.

Build the wiki offline
======================

To check your translations before you send them, you may want to browse the
wiki offline. See the [[corresponding documentation|contribute/build/website]].

Search for fuzzy strings with Vim
=================================

Ran inside Vim, the following command will search recursively for *fuzzy*
inside *.fr.po* files

    :vimgrep /fuzzy/ **/*.fr.po |:copen

To switch easily between the file list and the editor, using Alt + Arrow
up/down, you can add those lines in .vimrc:

    nmap <silent> <A-Up> :wincmd k<CR>
    nmap <silent> <A-Down> :wincmd j<CR>

Check the validity of PO files
==============================

Use the tool [i18nspector](http://jwilk.net/software/i18nspector).

To copy, install and run it issue the following commands in the folder where
you want to download it:

    apt-get install i18nspector/unstable
    i18nspector <PO file>

Run i18nspector on the whole wiki
=================================

    cd wiki/src
    contribute/l10n_tricks/check_po.sh

Translation database
=================================

[Open-tran.eu](http://open-tran.eu/) is a web database of all strings translated by many open-source projects. Use this to find canonical translations of computer-related terms.
