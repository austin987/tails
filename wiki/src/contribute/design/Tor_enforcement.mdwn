T(A)ILS short description states that all outgoing connections to the
Internet are forced to go through the [Tor network](https://www.torproject.org/).

This is almost true. Let's clarify this a bit.

[[!toc levels=2]]

Exceptions
==========

We said this is *almost* true since there are exceptions. Some
programs are allowed to connect to the Internet *directly* i.e.
bypassing Tor.

HTP
---

T(A)ILS HTP setup is described on a [[dedicated design page|design/HTP]].

Every HTP-related communication is established by the `htp` user, who
is allowed to connect *directly* to services listening on the `https`
TCP port or on the `domain` UDP/TCP ports.

The rationale for this exception is that we have kind of a
chicken'n'egg problem here. We want the clock to be pretty accurate in
order for Tor to work properly so HTP time synchronization has to be
done before Tor starts... hence *directly*. This means DNS queries to
resolve the HTP hosts IPs, and HTTPS traffic to fetch the pages and
associated resources.

I2P
---

See [[I2P]].

Local Area Network (LAN)
------------------------

T(A)ILS short description talks of *outgoing connections to the
Internet*. Indeed: traffic to the local LAN is wide open as well as
the loopback traffic obviously.

We want to [[forbid LAN DNS queries|todo/forbid_lan_dns_queries]] at
some point to protect against some attacks; this is not implemented
yet.

Special cases
=============

What about IPv6?
----------------

Tor does not support IPv6 yet so IPv6 communication is allowed only on
the loopback interface.

UDP, ICMP and other non-TCP protocols
-------------------------------------

Non-TCP traffic to the Internet is dropped. Tor only supports TCP.

Implementation
==============

Firewall
--------

Iptables/netfilter firewall rules implement the above described
specifications; see these files in the source tree for details:

- `config/chroot_local-includes/etc/firewall.conf` for IPv4
- `config/chroot_local-includes/etc/firewall6.conf` for IPv6
- `config/chroot_local-includes/etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/00-firewall.sh`

The default case is to redirect traffic to the Tor transparent proxy.

The following IPv4 address ranges are whitelisted:

- 192.168.0.0/255.255.0.0: private RFC1918 networks
- 10.0.0.0/255.0.0.0: private RFC1918 networks
- 172.16.0.0/255.240.0.0: private RFC1918 networks
- 127.0.0.0/255.128.0.0 and 127.128.0.0/255.192.0.0: loopback traffic,
  excluding the VirtualAddrNetwork (127.192.0.0/10) used for .onion:s

The following Unix users have Tor-evasion priviledges:

- `debian-tor`: Tor itself obviously has to connect to the Internet
  without going through the Tor network
- `htp` and `i2p-daemon`: see above.

Proxy settings
--------------

In case the firewall is buggy or not properly started, other settings
are used as part of a defence in depth strategy:

- the GNOME proxy settings point to Polipo or to the Tor SOCKS proxy,
  depending on the application type:
  `config/chroot_local-includes/usr/share/amnesia/gconf/gnome_proxy.xml`
- the standard `http_proxy` and `HTTP_PROXY` environment variables are
  globally set in `/etc/environment` to point to Polipo.

DNS
---

Tor does not support UDP so we cannot simply redirect DNS queries to
the Tor transparent proxy.

The system resolver is setup to query a local caching DNS proxy
(namely: pdnsd) that forwards DNS queries to the Tor DNS resolver.

The caching DNS proxy is here for performance reasons only.
