[[!map pages="contribute/design/*"]]

**FIXME**

- find a way to integrate existing documentation; left to do: [[features]]
- missing:
 * iceweasel locale spoofing or not: balance between ease of use for
   non-English-speaking users and browser fingerprinting
 * browser fingerprinting: how this is actually implemented in
   T(A)ILS, what compromises are made, and what the actual results are
- have a look to the [Tor design
  document](https://svn.torproject.org/svn/projects/design-paper/tor-design.pdf)
  that might have content we need to put here
- parts of the [Live CD Best
  Practices](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/TheOnionRouter/LiveCDBestPractices)
  document on the Tor wiki that could be worth merging:
 * the "Goals" part is probably worth merging in the specification
 * the part about default Firefox bookmarks needs to be investigated
 * the part about disabling HTTP keepalive needs to be thought of
 * oh! we don't talk about swap yet
 * recommending a public source code repository (SVN, Git...) seems
   like a good idea: it eases tracking changes and thus makes the peer
   review process quicker
 * the *Reproducibility* section is probably worth merging in the
   specification
- be more explicit about the post-mortem forensics issue. There might
  not be much to say but I think that it should at least be mentioned
  in the requirements, part 2:
  * What is required for a PELD to prevent from post-mortem analysis?
  * How do we think this should be provided?
- More generally this whole post-mortem analysis thingie is the real
  difference to put forward while talking to the Tor people; bringing
  their privacy concerns further than just the Internet connection.
  You can be a Tor freak and get the same Tor configuration as T(A)ILS
  on your own system but you won't get the same post-mortem analysis
  protection.

# 1 Introduction

In this document we present a specification of a Privacy Enhancing
LiveDistro as well as an actual implementation of it called The
(Amnesic) Incognito Live System (in short: *T(A)ILS*).

This document is heavily based on preliminary work that was done as
part of [Incognito 2008.1-r1
Documentation](http://www.browseanonymouslyanywhere.com/incognito/uploadfiles/docs.html).

# 2 Privacy Enhancing LiveDistro Specification

## 2.1 Intent

### 2.1.1 Privacy on the Internet

The Privacy Enhancing LiveDistro (or PELD for short) aims at providing
a software solution presenting the user with the technological means
for using popular Internet technologies while maintaining the privacy
of the user, in particular with respect to anonymity. While there are
different techniques and services providing that functionality, this
specification will assume the usage of [The Tor™
Project](https://www.torproject.org/)'s state-of-the-art anonymizing
overlay network Tor.

### 2.1.2 Working on sensitive documents

The PELD also aims at providing a "safe" environment to work on
sensitive documents:

- No trace must be left on local storage devices unless the user
  explicitly asks for it.
- The usage of encrypted removable storage devices (such as USB
  sticks) should be encouraged.
- No specific user information should be left in the sensitive documents made
  on or published with the PELD (for example EXIF data).

**FIXME**: I don't really understand the last requirement. It seems to
me this implies the PELD should modify on-the-fly any file present on
a USB stick, e.g. (but not only) when a user selects it in the web
browser to upload it; I doubt this is actually desirable. Providing
tools to remove metadata from documents would be a welcome bonus but I
am not sure about forcibly doing so. Also, "no specific user
information" seems pretty vague to me, as well as the restriction of
this requirement to "sensitive documents".

### 2.1.3 Portability

The PELD is supposed to be self-contained and portable (literally, not
necessarily with respect to code portability), and thus possible to
run in as many computing environments as possible fot the same single
distribution. In addition, while the PELD's main objective indeed is
to act as a traditional LiveDistro (i.e. a [[!wikipedia Live_CD]] or
[[!wikipedia Live_USB]]) it should also be compatible with popular
virtual machine technologies for users that simply want a sandboxed
environment within their normal operating system.

### 2.1.4 Target user

The PELD's target user is the average user in terms of computer
literacy, and who is using a computer of which he or she not
necessarily have full control of. Examples would be a public computer
in a library, coffee shop, university or a residence. The target user
is assumed to not want to do any of the configurations (at least with
respect to security and anonymity) of the various applications and
tools used themselves, either because of insufficient knowledge, lack
of interest or other reasons. The PELD should provide strong anonymity
with no need of advanced configuration whatsoever. It should be made
as difficult as possible for the user to unknowingly compromise
anonymity.

### 2.1.5 Summary

In short, the PELD aims at providing privacy on computers and on the
Internet for anyone anywhere.

## 2.2 Threat model

The goal of staying anonymous and keeping sensitive information
protected stands in direct conflict with the goals of several entities
"present" on the Internet. The following threat model is meant to
describe the intentions and capabilities of such hypothetical
attackers.

### 2.2.1 The goal of the attacker

- **Identify the user's activities on the Internet**: Information such
  as user-agent, locale and (especially) IP address can all be used in
  various degrees to identify the user.
- **Eavesdrop on sensitive data**: The Tor network only prevents the
  data from being traced (according to Tor's threat model) but does not
  protect it from eavesdropping.
- **Post-mortem user activity and sensitive data recovery (forensics)**:
  "Normal" operating systems keep a lot of traces about their users'
  Internet activities (notably browser cache and cookies) on local
  storage media; similarly, working on a sensitive document with a
  "normal" operating system is likely to leave traces of this
  document. The adversary may want to recover such information by
  analyzing the equipment that has been used.

### 2.2.2 Capabilities, methods and other means of the attacker

- **Eavesdropping**: It is assumed that the adversary is non-global
  and has full control over the network traffic of some fractions of
  the Internet (e.g. some exit nodes or the Internet connection the
  user is sitting behind).
- **Bypass attacks**: It is conceivable for attackers to mount attacks
  which bypass the proxy and DNS setup in the applications which could
  then be used to identify the user, either by injecting data or
  social engineering.
- **Exploit software vulnerabilities**: The attacker might be able to
  run arbitrary code by exploiting unpatched vulnerabilities present
  in any of the software packages installed.
- **Application level attacks**: The attacker can utilize certain
  applications' services and features to get identifying information.
  Examples are JavaScript and Java applets in web browsers, CTCP
  queries in IRC clients, etc.
- **Post-mortem equipment analysis**: The adversary might raid the
  user at any moment and then confiscate and analyse the equipment,
  storage media and memory in particular.
- **Live physical monitoring**: the adversary might be physically
  monitoring the computer while the PELD is running on it.

## 2.3 Distribution

The PELD should be distributed in a common format that can easily be
used to install the PELD on the selected medium. For instance, if
distributed as an ISO 9660 compatible image file it can be burned to a
CD with almost any CD recording software available.

Also, it is recommended to make it possible for end-users to verify
the downloaded PELD support integrity using public key cryptography.

## 2.4 Operational requirements

This section handles mostly the criteria that the PELD should be
portable and able to run in as many environments as possible. It also
deals with issues such as virus infections and leaving traces.

### 2.4.1 Platform

The binaries should all be executable on the most common computer
hardware architecture(s). As of 2011, the x86 computer architecture
seems to be the obvious choice as the vast majority of personal
computers in use is compatible with it. Supporting the PowerPC
architecture is a welcome bonus in order to support pre-Intel Apple
computers.

### 2.4.2 Media

The PELD should be able to boot and run from either CD or a USB drive.
While running the PELD in that mode it should be completely
independent from the host operating system and all other storage media
on the host computer unless the user explicitly tries to access any of
them.

In all circumstances, binaries, dynamic libraries and other executable
code susceptible to virus infections and similar should always be
completely write-protected, even when running from a writeable USB
medium. Such files should not even be modifiable temporarily, which
could be the case even when running from CD if the filesystem is
loaded into memory (e.g. tmpfs).

Configuration files, temporary files, user home directories and
similar files that most likely need to be modifiable during operation
should only be saved temporarily in memory (e.g. by use of something
like tmpfs or unionfs).

It is tempting to utilize the possibility to write back data when
running from USB as that could be used to allow user settings to be
persistent. If this is considered, this feature should be optional and
offer the possibility to use string encryption for the persistent
storage.

### 2.4.3 Virtual machines

As an alternative to running the PELD natively from a CD or USB, it
should also be possible to run from virtual machines. This is useful
in situations where the user might not have the possibility to run the
PELD natively, which often can be the case with public computers.
Additionally, many users seem to prefer this mode of operation, and
that alone is a reason for making sure it works.

## 2.5 Kernel requirements

The role of the kernel is mainly to provide support for the features
required elsewhere in this specification. This includes:

- **Good hardware support**: "Good" is a sketchy word in a
  specification. The general idea is to include as much drivers for
  relevant hardware as possible, in particular for network cards
  (wired and wireless), video card and anything necessary for basic
  operation.
- **Support for a stateful firewall with packet filtering
  capabilities**: It must somehow be able to separate between traffic
  for the functionality of the transparent proxying mentioned in the
  network section to work. Similarly, it must be able to identify and
  drop non-TCP traffic destined to the Internet.
- **Security features**: With the dangers of exploitable
  vulnerabilities in any code running, attempts to mitigate these on
  the kernel level is a good idea. Executable space protection with
  the NX bit, address space layout randomization and similar
  techniques are all interesting in this respect. Access control in
  the form of Mandatory Access Control, Role-Based Access control and
  so on should also be considered.

## 2.6 Network requirements

In order to prevent accidental leaks of information, proxy bypass
attacks on Tor and similar, the access to the Internet should be
heavily restricted by a firewall:

- All non-TCP protocols should be dropped as they are not supported by
  the Tor network.
- All TCP traffic not explicitly targeting Tor should be redirected to
  the transparent proxy (i.e. to the `TransPort` as set in `torrc`).
- All DNS lookups should be made through the Tor network (i.e.
  redirected to `DNSPort` as set in `torrc`).
- All IPv6 traffic must be forbidden as it is not supported by the Tor
  network.

Note that the above is not necessary (or desirable) for local network
(RFC1918) addresses; it is recommended to special-case DNS queries though as
some home routers and captive wifi portals reply the public IP
provided by the ISP when a reverse-lookup of their local host name is
attempted (source: [The State of the DNS and Tor Union (also: a DNS UDP
- TCP shim)](http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Jul-2010/msg00007.html)
thread on the or-talk mailing-list).

Any exception to these rules must be thoroughly thought of and
properly documented.

## 2.7 User interface and applications

### 2.7.1 General user interface

The user should be able to do all relevant things with easy to use
graphical interfaces. As such it should be presented a solid,
user-friendly desktop environment with all the expected features after
booting: file management, system settings configuration, support
applications etc.

### 2.7.2 Internet applications

At minimum, clients for the following Internet activities must be
supported:

- **Web browsing**: In the case of web browsing we really encourage
  the use of Firefox as the Tor Project itself has an extension,
  Torbutton, specifically designed for mitigating the risks with non-HTTP
  features, such as JavaScript. Efforts should also be made to avoid browser
  fingerprint, so that it won't reveal the use of a PELD.
- **Emailing**: Support for PGP or S/MIME is highly recommended. Also,
  beware that the EHLO/HELO sent to the SMTP-server will contain the
  host's IP address in many email clients. The `Message-ID` headers and
  HTML/JavaScript email support are other usual leaking spots that
  should be taken care of.
- **IRC and Instant messaging**
- **SSH**

Other recommended clients for Internet activities include:

- **Bittorrent and/or other type(s) of P2P file-sharing**: Note,
  however, that large scale file-sharing activity in general is
  frowned upon in the Tor community as it consumes extreme amounts of
  bandwidth compared to other kinds of services.
- **Collaborative text editor** such as [Gobby](http://gobby.0x539.de).
- **Remote desktop**

Given that these applications will be the user's interface to the
Internet, these should be chosen with care and security in mind, and
also configured in such a way. In general, as little information as
possible should leak about the user, the applications used and the
system settings.

### 2.7.3 Document production applications

**FIXME**: the PELD intents to allow "Working on sensitive documents"
=> software for non-Internet activities: word processor, bitmap and
vector graphics, DTP, PO editor, sound recording and editing,
printer and scanner support.

### 2.7.4 Tor

Tor should be setup to enable its DNS server (`DNSPort`) and transparent
proxy (`TransPort`, `TransListen`) so the functionality specified in the
network section is covered. Since Tor really is at the core of the
PELD only stable releases should be considered. Also, while there are
many other interesting configurations to consider in the Tor manual,
none of them that impairs anonymity or security should be set.

A GUI Tor controller application such as Vidalia or TorK is highly
recommended. However, this requires opening the control port in Tor,
and thus some means of authentication will be required
(`CookieAuthentication` preferably) to hinder attacks on the Tor
software.

### 2.7.5 Hardened tool chain and compiling

**FIXME**: change the "compile all software" recommendation into
something like "carefully balance the added security provided by
compiling all software with hardening options vs. cost in developers
time, ease of maintenance and new contributors involvement".

As an addition to the security against exploitable vulnerabilities
provided by the kernel, compiling software with stack smashing
protection, address space layout randomization and similar compiler
security enhancements is recommended. Note that in some circumstances
compiler level stuff is necessary for utilizing the kernel security
features. Because of this it is recommended to compile essentially all
software from sources to take benefit from these security features.

### 2.7.6 Cryptographic tools

Tools for securely signing, verifying, encrypting and decrypting files
and messages should be available. In particular some implementation of
OpenPGP should be included as it in practice is the de-facto standard
when it comes to these things. GUIs for managing keys and performing
the relevant cryptographic tasks should be available. The OpenPGP
implementation should be pre-configured to use an encrypted tunnel
when connecting to a keyserver (read: `hkps://`). Also, it should by
default use up-to-date digests, ciphers and key sizes with respect to
the current commonly agreed best practices.

Tools for creating encrypted storage containers are also recommended.

### 2.7.7 "Virtual" input system

As one of the PELD intent is to permit usage of untrusty computers while
preserving anonymity, measures should be taken against hardware that
might prevent it, such as hardware 
[keyloggers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keylogger). Thus a virtual
keyboard (usable with the mouse) should be available.

### 2.7.8 Entropy

Some crucial applications of the PELD, such as the Tor client, make
heavy use of cryptographic techniques and therefore rely on a high
quality proper pseudo-random number generator (PRNG). Initializing
(seeding) a PRNG is tricky in a Live system context as the system
state after boot, if not fully deterministic, is parametrized by far
less variables than in the case of a non-Live system.

Using an auxiliary entropy source such as
[haveged](http://www.irisa.fr/caps/projects/hipsor/) should thus be
considered.

## 2.8 Usability

Security is usually hard to get. Therefore steps need to be taken in
order to make the user more comfortable with the PELD, and also to
educate the user about the specific risks and quirks with respect to
anonymity on the Internet.

### 2.8.1 Internationalization

The user should be able to easily select his of her language of
preference. User applications should be localized to fit this
preference, as should system settings such as keyboard layout.

The PELD documentation, either online or shipped within, should be
easily translatable. Software written specifically for the PELD should
be developed with i18n/l10n-awareness in mind.

### 2.8.2 Education and user help

The PELD should include an easily read document explaining how to use
it and its software securely. The user should be assumed to only have
the knowledge of an average computer user, so it will be required to
explain some general security concepts.

Real-world experience demonstrates that the average user quite rarely
thinks about upgrading his or her PELD copy, and is often pretty happy
running an obsolete version affected by numerous well-known security
issues. A PELD running copy should therefore notice it is affected by
known security issues and notify the user if a newer release fixes
some.

## 2.9 Other considerations

### 2.9.1 Maintainability

The procedure to update the PELD should not be prohibitive to provide
timely software updates to address issues related to security or
anonymity. A scripted, automatic build procedure is greatly preferred
to manually setting up things.

### 2.9.2 Sustainability

PELD development should be a team work rather than a one person work,
and the deep knowledge of this work should be shared between the team
members. Thus the development infrastructure should be thought and
deployed in order to share this knowledge.

### 2.9.3 Open-source transparency

For the sake of transparency the use of open-source software is
encouraged. Binary blobs should only be used when no good alternatives
exist, which could be the case with certain hardware drivers or driver
firmwares.

Similarly, it is recommended for the PELD itself to be open-source, and
well documented to help security analysis by third-parties.

### 2.9.4 Easy feedback

In order to collect bug reports, wanted features and so on, the PELD
project should offer easy ways for end-users to provide feedback to the
developers (email, web forum, bug tracker, shipped-within application,
...). Efforts should be made to offer the most anonymous (or at least
pseudonymous) possible way to send this feedback.

# 3 Implementation

T(A)ILS is an implementation of the PELD specification above. It is
licensed under the GNU GPL version 3 or (at your option) any later
version.

Critical parts of the config (firewall, polipo and Tor config) are
based on the ones from the well known and trusted Incognito.

**NOTICE**: This distribution is provided as-is with no warranty of
fitness for a particular purpose, including total anonymity. Anonymity
depends not only on the software but also on the user understanding
the risks involved and how to overcome those risks.

## 3.1 Download

See the [[download section|download]] on [[T(A)ILS's main site|/index]] for download information.

The sources are stored in a bunch of [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
repositories. See the [[git page|git]] on the T(A)ILS wiki for
details.

The latest version of this document can be found on the T(A)ILS
website: [[!tails_website contribute/design]].

## 3.2 Software

The following software is used in T(A)ILS. This list is not complete,
but only contains packages deemed as important for whatever reason.
The full packages list can be found in the [BitTorrent files download
directory](/torrents/files/) (look for files with the `.packages`
extension).

### 3.2.1 Core software
 
- [Debian GNU/Linux](http://www.debian.org/): The base operating
  system, provides hardware detection, infrastructure. Please note
  that the Debian distribution does not provide or endorse this
  software distribution.
- [Debian Live](http://live.debian.net/): Toolkit to build Live
  systems based on Debian.
- [Tor](http://www.torproject.org/): Anonymizing overlay network for
  TCP. Our intention is to always use the latest stable version.
- [polipo](http://www.pps.jussieu.fr/%7Ejch/software/polipo/):
  Caching web proxy.
- [macchanger](http://www.alobbs.com/macchanger): Utility for
  viewing/manipulating the MAC address of network interfaces.
- [pdnsd](http://www.phys.uu.nl/%7Erombouts/pdnsd.html): Caching DNS
  proxy. Configured to forward lookups through Tor.

**FIXME**: explain why we don't recompile everything with hardened
tool chain. Be accurate about the present/missing kernel security
features.

### 3.2.2 Virtual keyboard

- [onBoard](https://launchpad.net/onboard) virtual keyboard as a
  countermeasure against hardware keyloggers.

### 3.2.3 Other applications

**FIXME**: insert an excerpt here (mainly software that is required or
recommended by the above specification)

- [cryptsetup](http://code.google.com/p/cryptsetup/) ensures storage
  encryption using [LUKS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LUKS).
- [gnupg](http://gnupg.org) complete and free implementation of the
  OpenPGP standard.
- [Torbutton](https://www.torproject.org/torbutton) offers all kind of
  protection against non-HTML anonymity attacks.
- [haveged](http://freshmeat.net/projects/haveged) feeds /dev/random
  using HArdware Volatile Entropy Gathering and Expansion algorithm.
- [Vidalia](https://www.torproject.org/projects/vidalia.html.en) is used
  to control Tor's behavior.
- [secure-delete](http://www.thc.org) a tool to securely wipe data from files,
  swap or memory.

See [[features]] for a partial list of bundled software.

## 3.3 Internationalization

The following locales are installed. If you'd like to see another
locale, please let us know.

- ar (Arabic)
- ar_EG.UTF-8 (Egyptian Arabic)
- de, de_DE.UTF-8 (German)
- es, es_ES.UTF-8 (Castellano)
- en_US, en_US.UTF-8 (American English)
- fr, fr_FR.UTF-8 (French)
- it, it_IT.UTF-8 (Italian)
- pt, pt_PT.UTF-8 (Portuguese)
- ru, ru_RU.UTF-8 (Russian)
- zh, zh_CN.UTF-8 (Chinese)

The chosen locale's files are compiled at boot time.

See `config/amnesia` for the selected languages. See
`config/chroot_local-preseed/localepurge` and grep the source for
`AMNESIA_SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES` for how this configuration is applied.

## 3.4 Notification of security issues and new T(A)ILS release

Shipped in T(A)ILS is a script that checked at each desktop start if
security issues or new T(A)ILS released are published on the website. If
some are found, a notification is printed on the desktop. This
application is internationalized.

See [[!tails_gitweb
chroot_local-includes/usr/local/bin/tails-security-check]]

## 3.5 Configuration

In this section we briefly present the setup of several key software
packages and system settings of T(A)ILS with respect to security and
anonymity. There are of course other minor tweaks here and there, but
those are mainly for usability issues and similar.

### 3.5.1 The Tor™ software

The Tor software is currently configured as a client only. The client
listens on SOCKS port 9050 with a control port 9051 (using cookie
authentication), as a transparent proxy on port 9040 and as a DNS
server on port 8853. Only connections from localhost are accepted. It
can be argued that running a server would increase your anonymity for
a number for reasons but we still feel that most users probably would
not want this due to the added consumption of bandwidth.
 
- [[!tails_gitweb chroot_local-includes/etc/tor/torrc]]

### 3.5.3 DNS

[[!inline pages="contribute/design/Tor_enforcement/DNS" raw=yes]]

### 3.5.4 HTTP Proxy

[[!inline pages="contribute/design/Tor_enforcement/Proxy" raw=yes]]

### 3.5.5 SOCKS libraries

tsocks and torify are installed. Note that it is unnecessary with the
Linux network filter (see below) and the local DNS server to torify
applications. This is done at a lower level. These tools are solely
here due to dependencies and configured for completeness.

- [[!tails_gitweb config/chroot_local-includes/etc/tor/tor-tsocks.conf]]

### 3.5.6 Network Filter

[[!inline pages="contribute/design/Tor_enforcement/Network_filter" raw=yes]]

### 3.5.7 Random MAC Address

**FIXME**: this is not implemented yet. See the related [[design
document|design/MAC_address]] and [[todo item|todo/macchanger]].

### 3.5.8 Iceweasel

(Note: Iceweasel is the name of the web browser, based on Mozilla
Firefox, that is shipped by Debian and thus by T(A)ILS.)

**FIXME**: the only history-related setting I can find in our
Iceweasel config is:

    pref/iceweasel.js:pref("browser.history_expire_days", 0);

Does this really mean history disabled? If it does, I wonder if we
really need/want this.

Iceweasel uses Torbutton in order to prevent attacks using JavaScript,
plugins and other non-HTTP features like web bugs. It is configured to
always be enabled on Iceweasel start and uses polipo as HTTP(s) proxy
and Tor as SOCKS proxy. SOCKS is configured to perform name resolution
through the proxy. Iceweasel is also configured to not cache to disk
(mainly to reduce memory usage for CD users as disk writes will be
stored there), history is disabled (just in case) and many other things. It is also setup
not to automatically check for updates of its installed extensions.
Java support is disabled.

Iceweasel is shipped with some extensions to help users into managing
their browsing experience. The
[cslite](https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/5207/)
extension blocks by default all cookies and provides a button for the
user to accept cookies only on websites where the user needs it. This
prevents the known leak of browsing informations cookies can lead to.
The [Adblock plus](https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/1865/)
extension prevent users from leaving traces of their web browsing by
removing all ads. The [firegpg](http://getfiregpg.org/) plugin allows
users to use GnuPG inside websites like webmails.

**FIXME**: any mention of foxyproxy was removed in 813eea6e. While not
shipped in a stable release yet, it is planned for the next one and
installed in the devel branch. IMHO we should mention this.

The Iceweasel config is pretty heavily commented, so any other relevant
settings may be investigated by looking in it.

- [[!tails_gitweb config/chroot_local-includes/etc/iceweasel/]]

### 3.5.9 Claws Mail

**FIXME: adapt and rewrite, using [[the audit draft|todo/applications_audit/claws_mail]]**

Claws Mail generates `Message-ID` headers using the hostname part
of the sender's email address, which is ok.

It also always says `EHLO localhost` to the SMTP server instead of
disclosing the real IP address and hostname.

Furthermore, the accounts that a user will create are pre-configured
to not use HTML as that otherwise may break PGP usage.

- [[!tails_gitweb config/chroot_local-includes/etc/skel/.claws-mail/]] is copied to
  the user's `$HOME` at boot time

### 3.5.11 Pidgin

Pidgin is configured to not log anything as well as not to reveal too
much of user activity by disabling online/away reporting. MSN protocol
support is disabled, to avoid the usage of such a privacy flawed and
buggy plugin. The Off-the-record plugin is enabled to help one to one
conversations being as private and unrecordable as possible. A script
generates at each boot a random nick to be used on the preconfigured IRC
servers.

### 3.5.12 Host system swap

**FIXME**: explain T(A)ILS does its best not to use any swap partition
that could be found at runtime:

- not using live-boot's swapon option
- config/chroot_local-hooks/03-noswap
- config/chroot_local-hooks/05-disable_swapon

### 3.5.13 Host system RAM

**FIXME: mention this is currently sometimes buggy and not to be relied on (yet)**

When shutting down the system RAM is securely wiped. RAM can actually
be read after the machine shuts off with the right equipment. The
software doing this is smem, part of the
[secure-delete](http://www.thc.org/) package. This process can take a
while. If you are booting from a CD it should eject, and if you are
booting from a USB drive you can remove the drive once prompted. In
either case you can leave the computer and let it finish on its own,
or simply turn it off if you are not worried about this attack.

- [[!tails_live-boot_gitweb debian/live-boot.init]]

### 3.5.14 Host system disks and partitions

**FIXME**: some LiveDistros read the disks and possibly mount the
available partitions automatically. T(A)ILS does not do so for fixed
disks.

Hints to the one who will write this part:

- grep nopersistent config/amnesia
- probably a few GConf settings in
  config/chroot_local-includes/usr/share/amnesia/gconf/
- udev / GNOME / udisks: removable vs. fixed

### 3.5.15 Passwords

There are two users that are intended to be used for logins, `amnesia`
and `root`. Both have `amnesia` set as a password, and the `amnesia`
user is allowed to gain super user privileges, without providing a
password, using `sudo`.

The user will remove the CD/USB when done and there should be no
services allowing logins from the network, but still: we are aware of
the security risks involved by password-less sudo and are [[working on
it|todo/better_root_access_control]].

As a first step the next major T(A)ILS release will stop grant `sudo`
privileges to the `amnesia` user; a root console will be available for
two minutes after boot: this leaves the user 2 minutes to set a root
password. Unless this is done before this delay has expired, the root
console will be disabled, and no root access will be possible anymore.

## 3.6 Running T(A)ILS in virtual machines

T(A)ILS may of course be run in virtual machines. Due to the
popularity of [VMWare](http://www.vmware.com/) we include
[open-vm-tools](http://open-vm-tools.sourceforge.net/) (an open-source
alternative to VMware tools) as well as special video drivers
for an improved user experience in that environment. Due to the
closed-source nature of VMWare we try to encourage users of open VMs,
like [VirtualBox](http://virtualbox.org/) and
[QEMU](http://www.qemu.org/), by making sure that
these also work. In the case of VirtualBox both video and input
drivers are included, as well as the guest utilities.

Security concerns for all VMs are a keyloggers, viruses and other
malware in the host OS which a guest OS like T(A)ILS cannot defend
against. T(A)ILS therefore tries to detect whether it is run inside a
VM and [[warns the user|design/virtualization_support]] if it is.

## 3.7 Running T(A)ILS inside a Windows session

**FIXME**: not implemented yet, see the
[[todo/virtualization_support]] TODO item. Let's implement this
instead of changing the following paragraph :)

[QEMU](http://www.qemu.org/) for Microsoft Window ships with T(A)ILS
and is used to run the CD/USB in a virtual machine whenever native
boot is impossible or not desirable. Note that this will work for
Windows 2000/XP or greater only.

## 3.8 Build process and maintenance

The Debian Live release build tool is used to build T(A)ILS. This tool
is designed automate the build process of the target distribution,
which also make them easy to maintain.

For detailed instructions on how to build and modify T(A)ILS, see
[[build]] and [[contribute]] on the wiki.

The following applications are kept up to date as soon as possible.

- Tor (stable releases only) 
- Vidalia 

Remaining applications, including the base system, will be updated
using Debian standard upgrade process, and generally based on the
latest Debian stable release so there are not many problems.

## 3.9 Hardware support

T(A)ILS ships with the latest kernel from [Debian
Backports](http://backports.debian.org) as a compromise between
stability and recent hardware support.

The x86 hardware architecture is the main supported one but work is
ongoing to additionally support the PowerPC architecture.

## 3.10 Caveats

UDP and IPv6 are a problem. The Tor network does not support any of
those yet. Outgoing UDP and IPv6 packets are dropped altogether by
netfilter for this reason.

Also, an easy (read: not command-line based) way to [[install and
upgrade T(A)ILS on USB sticks|todo/usb_install_and_upgrade]] is
needed.

Some optional bits of [[todo/persistence]] would be welcome and help
spreading strong public key cryptography and authentication amongst
T(A)ILS users (OpenPGP, [[todo/Monkeysphere]]).

See the [[contribute/roadmap]] for more information about where
T(A)ILS is heading to.
