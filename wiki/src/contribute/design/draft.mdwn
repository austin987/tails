## 1 Introduction

In this document we present a specification of a Privacy Enhancing
LiveDistro as well as an actual implementation of it called Incognito.

## 2 Anonymity LiveDistro Specification

### 2\.1 Intent

The Privacy Enhancing LiveDistro (or PELD for short) aims at providing
a software solution presenting the user with the technological means
for using popular Internet technologies while maintaining the privacy
of the user, in particular with respect to anonymity. While there are
different techniques and services providing that functionality, this
specification will assume the usage of [The Tor™
Project](https://www.torproject.org/)'s state-of-the-art anonymizing
overlay network Tor.

The PELD is supposed to be self-contained and portable (literally, not
necessarily with respect to code portability), and thus possible to
run in as many computing environments as possible fot the same single
distribution. In addition, while the PELD's main objective indeed is
to act as a traditional LiveDistro (i.e. a LiveCD or LiveUSB) it
should also be compatible with popular virtual machine technologies
for users that simply want a sandboxed environment within their normal
operating system.

The PELD's target user is the average user in terms of computer
literacy, and who is using a computer of which he or she not
necessarily have full control of. Examples would be a public computer
in a library, coffee shop, university or a residence. The target user
is assumed to not want to do any of the configurations (at least with
respect to security and anonymity) of the various applications and
tools used themselves, either because of insufficient knowledge, lack
of interest or other reasons. The PELD should provide strong anonymity
with no need of advanced configuration whatsoever. It should be made
as difficult as possible for the user to unknowingly compromise
anonymity.

In short, the PELD aims at providing privacy on the Internet for anyone anywhere.

### 2\.2 Threat model

The goal of staying anonymous and keeping sensitive information
protected stands in direct conflict with the gols of several entities
"present" on the Internet. The following threat model is meant to
describe the intentions and capabilities of such hypothetical
attackers:

#### 2\.2.1 The goal of the attacker

- **Identify the user's activities on the Internet**: Information such
  as user-agent, locale and (especially) IP address can all be used in
  various degrees to identify the user.
- **Eavesdrop on sensitive data**: Sensitive data sent through the Tor
  network will only be untraceable (with respect to Tor's threat
  model) and thus will be at least as likely to be eavesdropped.

#### 2\.2.2 Capabilities, methods and other means of the attacker

- **Eavesdropping**: It is assumed that the attacker can observe any
  traffic that exits the Tor network.
- **Bypass attacks**: It is conceivable for attackers to mount attacks
  which bypass the proxy and DNS setup in the applications which could
  then be used to identify the user, either by injecting data or
  social engineering.
- **Explot software vulnerabilities**: The attacker might be able to
  run arbitrary code by exploiting unpatched vulnerabilities present
  in any of the software packages installed.
- **Application level attacks**: The attacker can utilize certain
  applications' services and features to get identifying information.
  Examples are JavaScript and Java applets in web browsers, CTCP
  queries in IRC clients, etc.

### 2\.3 Distribution

The PELD should be distributed in a common format that can easily be
used to install the PELD on the selected medium. For instance, if
distributed as an ISO 9660 compatible image file it can be burned to a
CD with almost any CD recording software available.

### 2\.4 Operational requirements

This section handles mostly the criteria that the PELD should be
portable and able to run in as many environments as possible. It also
deals with issues such as virus infections and leaving traces.

#### 2\.4.1 Platform

The binaries should all be executable on the most common computer
hardware architecture(s). As of 2008, the x86 computer architecture
seems to be the obvious choice as the vast majority of personal
computers in use is compatible with it.

#### 2\.4.2 Media

The PELD should be able to boot and run from either CD or a USB drive.
While running the PELD in that mode it should be completely
independent from the host operating system and all other storage media
on the host computer unless the user explicitly tries to access any of
them.

In all circumstances, binaries, dynamic libraries and other executable
code susceptible to virus infections and similar should always be
completely write-protected, even when running from a writeable USB
medium. Such files should not even be modifiable temporarily, which
could be the case even when running from CD if the filesystem is
loaded into memory (e.g. tmpfs).

Configuration files, temporary files, user home directories and
similar files that most likely need to be modifiable during operation
should only be saved temporarily in memory (e.g. by use of something
like tmpfs or unionfs).

It is tempting to utilize the possibility to write back data when
running from USB as that could be used to allow user settings to be
persistent. If this is considered, this feature should be optional and
offer the possibility to use string encryption for the persistent
storage.

#### 2\.4.3 Virtual machines

As an alternative to running the PELD natively from a CD or USB, it
should also be possible to run from virtual machines. This is useful
in situations where the user might not have the possibility to run the
PELD natively, which often can be the case with public computers.
Additionally, many users seem to prefer this mode of operation, and
that alone is a reason for making sure it works.

### 2\.5 Kernel requirements

The role of the kernel is mainly to provide support for the features
required elsewhere in this specification. This includes:

- **Good hardware support**: "Good" is a sketchy word in a
  specification. The general idea is to include as much drivers for
  relevant hardware as possible, in particular for network cards (wire
  and wireless), video card and other things necessary for basic
  operation.
- **Support for a stateful firewall with packet filtering
  capabilities**: It must be able to separate between traffic some how
  for the functionality of the transparent proxying mentioned in the
  [network section](#net) to work. Similarly, it must be able to
  identify and drop non TCP traffic destined to the Internet.
- **Security features**: With the dangers of exploitable
  vulnerabilities in any code running, attempts to mitigate these on
  the kernel level is a good idea. Executable space protection with
  the NX bit, address space layout randomization and similar
  techniques are all interesting in this respect. Access control in
  the form of Mandatory Access Control, Role-Based Access control and
  so on should also be considered.

### 2\.6 Network requirements

In order to prevent accidental leaks of information, proxy bypass
attacks on Tor and similar, the access to the Internet should be
heavily restricted by a firewall:

- All non-TCP protocols (except DNS) should be dropped as they are not
  supported by the Tor network.
- All TCP traffic not explicitly targeting Tor should be redirected to
  the transparent proxy (i.e. to the TransPort as set in torrc).
- All DNS lookups should be made through the Tor network (i.e.
  redirected to DNSPort as set in torrc).

Note that the above is not necessary (or desirable) for local network
addresses.

### 2\.7 User interface and applications

#### 2\.7.1 General user interface

The user should be able to do all relevant things with easy to use
graphical interfaces. As such it should be presented a solid,
user-friendly desktop environment with all the expected features (file
managing, change system settings, support applications etc.) after
booting.

#### 2\.7.2 Internet applications

At minimum, clients for the following Internet activities must be
supported:

- **Web browsing**: In the case of web browsing we really encourage the
  use of Mozilla Firefox as the Tor Project itself has an extension,
  Torbutton, specifically designed for mitigating the risks with
  non-HTTP features, such as JavaScript.
- **Emailing**: Support for PGP or S/MIME is highly recommended. Also,
  beware that the EHLO/HELO sent to the SMTP-server will contain the
  host's IP address in many email clients
- **IRC and Instant messaging**

Other recommended client for Internet activities includes:

- **Bittorrent and/or other type(s) of P2P file-sharing**: Note,
  however, that large scale file-sharing activity in general is
  frowned upon in the Tor community as it consumes extreme amounts of
  bandwidth compared to other kinds of services.
- **Remote desktop**
- **SSH**

Given that these applications will be the user's interface to the
Internet, these should be chosen with care and security in mind, and
also configured in such a way. In general, as little information as
possible should leak about the user, the applications used and the
system settings.

#### 2\.7.3 Tor

Tor should be setup to use its DNS server (DNSPort) and transparent
proxy (TransPort, TransListen) so the functionality specified in the
network section is covered. Since Tor really is at the core of the
PELD only stable releases should be considered. Also, while there are
many other interesting configurations to consider in the Tor manual,
none of them that impairs anonymity or security should be set.

A GUI Tor controller application such as Vidalia or TorK is highly
recommended. However, this requires opening the control port in Tor,
and thus some means of authentication will be required
(CookieAuthentication preferably) to hinder attacks on the Tor
software.

#### 2\.7.4 Hardened tool chain and compiling

As an addition to the security against exploitable vulnerabilities
provided by the kernel, compiling software with stack smashing
protection, address space layout randomization and similar compiler
security enhancements is recommended. Note that in some circumstances
compiler level stuff is necessary for utilizing the kernel security
features. Because of this it is recommended to compile essentially all
software from sources to take benefit from these security features.

#### 2\.7.5 Cryptographic tools

Tools for securely signing, verifying, encrypting and decrypting files
and messages should be available. In particular some implementation of
OpenPGP should be included as it in practice is the de-facto standard
when it comes to these things. GUIs for managing keys and performing
the relevant cryptographic tasks should be available. Tools for
creating encrypted storage containers are also recommended.

### 2\.8 Usability

Security is usually hard to get. Therefore steps need to be taken in
order to make the user more comfortable with the PELD, and also to
educate the user about the specific risks and quirks with respect to
anonymity on the Internet.

#### 2\.8.1 Internationalization

The user should be able to easily select his of her language of
preference. User applications should be localized to fit this
preference, as should system settings such as keyboard layout.

#### 2\.8.2 Education and user help

The PELD should include an easily read document explaining how to use
it and its software securely. The user should be assumed to only have
the knowledge of you average computer user, so there will be required
some explaining of general security concepts.

### 2\.9 Other considerations

#### 2\.9.1 Maintainability

The procedure to update the PELD should not be prohibitive to provide
timely software updates to address issues related to security or
anonymity. A scripted, automatic build procedure is greatly preferred
to manually setting up things.

#### 2\.9.2 Open-source transparency

For the sake of transparency the use of open-source software is
encouraged. Binary blobs should only be used when no good alternatives
exist, which could be the case with certain hardware drivers or driver
firmwares.

Similarly, it is recommended that the PELD itself is open-source, and
that it is well documented to help security analysis by third-parties.

## 3 Implementation

The Incognito LiveDistro is an implementation the [PELD
specification](#spec) above. It is licensed under the GNU GPL version
2.

**NOTICE**: This distribution is provided as-is with no warranty of
fitness for a particular purpose, including total anonymity. Anonymity
depends not only on the software but also on the user understanding
the risks involved and how to overcome those risks.

for the selected languages. See
[fsscript.sh](https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/incognito/trunk/fsscript.sh)
for how this configuration is applied.

### 3\.4 Configuration

In this section we briefly present the setup of several key software
packages and system settings of Incognito with respect to security and
anonymity. There are of course other minor tweaks here and there, but
those are mainly for usability issues and similar.

#### 3\.4.1 The Tor™ software

The Tor software is currently configured as a client only. The client
listens on SOCKS port 9050 with a control port 9051 (using cookie
authentication), as a transparent proxy on port 9040 and as a DNS
server on port 8853. Only connections from localhost are accepted. It
can be argued that running a server would increase your anonymity for
a number for reasons but we still feel that most users probably would
not want this due to the added consumption of bandwidth.

 
- [/etc/tor/torrc](https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/incognito/trunk/root_overlay/etc/tor/torrc)

#### 3\.4.2 Mixminion

Mixminion cannot be configured as a server as these servers need to be
very reliable. As a client the default configuration seems to be
acceptable. Note that TorK has built-in support for Mixminion with an
easy to use interface (lacking PGP support, unfortunately).

#### 3\.4.3 DNS

DNS leaks are controlled by using a local caching DNS server, pdnsd,
that in turn performs its DNS lookups through the Tor network. pdnsd
is the server configured in /etc/resolv.conf, listening on localhost.
There is a security concern that some application could attempt to do
its own DNS resolution without consulting /etc/resolv.conf, and
therefore UDP packets are blocked in order to prevent leaks. Another
solution may be to use the Linux network filter to forward UDP lookups
to the local DNS server.

- [/etc/resolv.conf](https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/incognito/trunk/root_overlay/etc/resolv.conf)
- [/etc/conf.d/pdnsd](https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/incognito/trunk/root_overlay/etc/conf.d/pdnsd)
- [/etc/tor/torrc](https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/incognito/trunk/root_overlay/etc/tor/torrc)
- [/etc/conf.d/net](https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/incognito/trunk/root_overlay/etc/conf.d/net)
- [/var/lib/iptables/rules-save](https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/incognito/trunk/root_overlay/var/lib/iptables/rules-save) (loaded by the standard Gentoo /etc/init.d/iptables service)

#### 3\.4.4 HTTP Proxy

Polipo provides with caching HTTP proxy functionality. It contacts the
Tor software via SOCKS5 to make the real connections.

- [/etc/polipo/config](https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/incognito/trunk/root_overlay/etc/polipo/config)
- [/etc/env.d/99proxy](https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/incognito/trunk/root_overlay/etc/env.d/99proxy)
- [/var/lib/kdesession/kioslaverc](https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/incognito/trunk/root_overlay/var/lib/kdesession/kioslaverc) (copied to /home/incognito/.kde/... during build)

#### 3\.4.5 SOCKS libraries

tsocks (patched for Tor usage as per the ebuild's tordns USE flag) and
dante are installed. Note that it is unnecessary with the Linux
network filter (see below) and the local DNS server to socksify or
torify applications. This is done at a lower level. These libraries
are here due to dependencies and configured for completeness.

- [/etc/socks/](https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/incognito/trunk/root_overlay/etc/socks/)
- [/etc/env.d/99proxy](https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/incognito/trunk/root_overlay/etc/env.d/99proxy)

#### 3\.4.6 Network Filter

One serious security issue is that we don't know what software will
attempt to contact the network and whether their proxy settings are
setup to use the Tor SOCKS proxy or polipo HTTP(s) proxy correctly.
This is solved by forwarding all direct TCP connections through Tor's
transparent proxy. Linux has a kernel level network filter that
accomplishes this.

- [/var/lib/iptables/rules-save](https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/incognito/trunk/root_overlay/var/lib/iptables/rules-save) (loaded by the standard Gentoo /etc/init.d/iptables service)
- [/etc/tor/torrc](https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/incognito/trunk/root_overlay/etc/tor/torrc)

#### 3\.4.7 Random MAC Address

The macchanger program can be used to change the network card MAC
addresses to a random value. Gentoo has direct support for macchanger
so all we need to do is configure it. The configuration is set to
"random-ending" which is equivalent to "macchanger -e", meaning the
vendor and media type are not changed. This is done to not draw
attention to the changed MAC address in case someone is watching.
Using a random MAC address may improve anonymity with respect to the
LAN and prevent mapping the user to a specific physical location.

This functionality is not enabled by default as some DHCP servers may
be configured with specific MAC addresses. In the boot menu there is
an "Enable/Disable MAC changer" option that can be set before a
language is chosen and the system starts booting.

- [/etc/init.d/macchanger](https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/incognito/trunk/root_overlay/etc/init.d/macchanger)

#### 3\.4.8 Mozilla Firefox

Firefox uses Torbutton in order to prevent attacks using JavaScript,
plugins and other non-HTTP features. It is configured to always be
enabled on Firefox start and uses polipo as HTTP(s) proxy and Tor as
SOCKS proxy. SOCKS is configured to perform name resolution through
the proxy. Firefox is also configured to not cache (mainly to reduce
memory usage for CD users as disk writes will be stored there),
history (just in case) and many other things. The Firefox config is
pretty heavily commented, so any other relevant settings may be
investigated by looking in it.

- [/var/lib/firefox-config/](https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/incognito/trunk/root_overlay/var/lib/firefox-config/) (copied to /home/incognito/.mozilla during build)
- [Firefox config](https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/incognito/trunk/root_overlay/var/lib/firefox-config/firefox/o2e6y2eh.default/prefs.js)

#### 3\.4.9 Mozilla Thunderbird

Thunderbird's proxy settings are set up to use Tor. An old version of
Torbutton (1.0.4.01, when it still supported Thunderbird) is installed
solely for the purpose of scrubbing the _real_ IP address and hostname
from the EHLO/HELO messages which otherwise would be sent in the clear
to the SMTP server. Furthermore, the first ten or so accounts that a
user will create are pre-configured to not use HTML as that otherwise
may break PGP usage. See the comments in the Thunderbird config for
more settings.

- [/var/lib/thunderbird-config/](https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/incognito/trunk/root_overlay/var/lib/thunderbird-config/) (copied to /home/incognito/.thunderbird during build)
- [Thunderbird config](https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/incognito/trunk/root_overlay/var/lib/thunderbird-config/rhy4kriw.default/prefs.js)

#### 3\.4.10 Bookmarks

Firefox have preset bookmarks related to anonymity.

- Firefox: [bookmarks.html](https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/incognito/trunk/root_overlay/var/lib/firefox-config/firefox/m7m1jk79.Default%20User/bookmarks.html)

#### 3\.4.11 XChat

XChat is configured to use the Tor software as a SOCKS5 proxy. It will
pass the hostname through SOCKS5 so that the exit node does the DNS
resolution. In addition all ctcp responses except PING are disabled as
they otherwise could disclose useragent, system time and other
information.

- [/var/lib/xchat-config](https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/incognito/trunk/root_overlay/var/lib/xchat-config)
- [/var/lib/ctcpreply.conf](https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/incognito/trunk/root_overlay/var/lib/ctcpreply.conf)
- [fsscript.sh](https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/incognito/trunk/fsscript.sh)

#### 3\.4.12 Pidgin

Pidgin is configured to not log anything and to use the Tor SOCKS
proxy. Additionally the Off-the-record Messaging plug-in and two IRC
enhancing plugins are loaded automatically. The IRC More plug-in is
patched to not report useragent and to use empty part/quit messages to
prevent fingerprinting.

- [/var/lib/pidgin-config/prefs.xml](https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/incognito/trunk/root_overlay/var/lib/pidgin-config/prefs.xml)
- a href="https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/incognito/trunk/portage.overlay/x11-plugins/purple-plugin\_pack/files/hide-stuff.patch"&gt;hide-stuff.patch

#### 3\.4.13 Host system RAM

When shutting down the system RAM is securely wiped. RAM can actually
be read after the machine shuts off with the right equipment. The
software doing this is smem, part of the
[secure-delete](http://www.thc.org/) package. This process can take a
while. If you are booting from a CD it should eject, and if you are
booting from a USB drive you can remove the drive once prompted. In
either case you can leave the computer and let it finish on its own,
or simply turn it off if you are not worried about this attack.

#### 3\.4.14 Passwords

There are two users that are intended to be used for logins,
'incognito' and 'root'. Since this is a CD/USB the passwords are
empty. This should not be a security concern because the user will
remove the CD/USB when done and there should be no services allowing
logins from the network. Suggestions for better solutions are welcome,
though.

### 3\.5 Running Incognito in virtual machines

Incognito may of course be run in virtual machines. Due to the
popularity of [VMWare](http://www.vmware.com/) we include
[open-vm-tools](http://open-vm-tools.sourceforge.net/) (an open-source
alternative to VMware tools) as well as special video and input divers
for an improved user experience in that environment. Due to the
closed-source nature of VMWare we try to encourage users of open VMs,
like [VirtualBox](http://virtualbox.org/) and
[QEMU](http://fabrice.bellard.free.fr/qemu/), by making sure that
these also work. In the case of VirtualBox both video and input
drivers are included.

Security concerns for all VMs are a keyloggers, viruses and other
malware in the host OS which a guest OS like Incognito cannot defend
against.

### 3\.6 Running Incognito inside a Windows session

[QEMU](http://fabrice.bellard.free.fr/qemu/) for Microsoft Window
ships with Incognito and is used to run the CD/USB in a virtual
machine whenever native boot is impossible or not desirable. Note that
this will work for Windows 2000/XP or greater only.

### 3\.7 Persistent User Settings for a USB drive

The CD may be copied to a USB drive. Why do that? USB drives are
easier to carry, harder to break, offer file storage and persistent
user settings between sessions. There is a script provided that will
copy the CD to a USB drive and make the drive bootable. Note the
script depends on the Gentoo LiveCD structure, it probably won't work
when run on another LiveCD setup.

The persistent home volume can be stored as a
[TrueCrypt](http://www.truecrypt.org/) volume or unencrypted. For the
Un\*x savvy, the unencrypted volume is stored as an ext3 file on the
USB drive. The file home.tc (TrueCrypt) or home.ext3.img (unencrypted)
on the USB drive and can be removed to reset to the CD defaults or
copied elsewhere for a backup. You will need to do a clean shut-down
to make sure your settings are saved. When booting from a writeable
medium and there is no home volume you will be prompted to create one,
you may choose not to do so and to disable the feature altogether with
the possibility to enable it again from within the GUI.

#### Configuration copied from USB drive

Certain configurations are copied from the USB drive on boot if no
persistent drive is mounted. Note that this feature is pretty secret
at the moment. A more elaborate and general filesystem overlaying
thing is in the works as a replacement.

The following table lists the configuration, where it should exist on
the USB drive and where it is copied into.

      <th align="left">USB drive location</th>

### 3\.8 Hidden Services

Hidden HTML content may be served if running from an USB drive.
Content is limited to static HTML pages. The content is stored in the
home directory and so takes advantage of TrueCrypt encryption. The
directory structure follows.

- /home/hidden/[name]Base directory for hidden content where [name]
  can be anything (sane) that you'd like.
- /home/hidden/[name]/confConfiguration directory mostly used for Tor
  hidden service information. It will include the hostname and private
  key, keep it safe, i.e. don't copy it over to your buddy's USB
  drive.
- /home/hidden/[name]/conf/portOptional port for the hidden service.
  This is what you'd give out to others. If you will have multiple
  services it is best to specify the port. The default is 80,
  increasing from there for each additional service.
- /home/hidden/[name]/conf/torrcOptional config to append to
  /etc/tor/torrc after the hidden service description. An example
  would be a HiddenServiceNodes directive, etc.
- /home/hidden/[name]/wwwThe HTML content. Use index.html for your
  default page.

The [lighttpd](http://www.lighttpd.net/) server is used to serve the
content. Configuration of the server is done at boot time in the
[/etc/init.d/hidden-service](https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/incognito/trunk/root_overlay/etc/init.d/hidden-service)
init script.

The host name to use for the hidden service can be found in the
/home/hidden/[name]/conf/hostname file for that service. This file is
created by the Tor software when configuring the hidden service. The
host name will be the same across sessions and machines as it and the
private key are stored in the /home/hidden/[name]/conf directory.

Changes to /home/hidden (service addition/removal,
/home/hidden/[name]/conf change) can be applied using the following
command from a terminal. To get a terminal on full, type "Alt-F2",
"konsole". On tiny right-click on the desktop and choose "xterm". ` su
-c /etc/init.d/hidden-service restart ` Note that content changes in
/home/hidden/[name]/www should take effect immediately without running
the above command.

### 3\.9 Build process and maintenance

The Gentoo Catalyst release build tool is used to build Incognito.
This tool is designed automate the build process of the target
distribution, which also make them easy to maintain. Since essentially
everything is compiled from sources, building Incognito from scratch
takes several hours or even a few days to complete. But this is seldom
done or needed and catalyst makes it possible to cache already built
packages so they need not be compiled again. Adding or removing
software to/from the distribution is also generally trivial but might
require altering the ebuild or writing new ones.

For detailed instructions on how to build and modify Incognito, see
`building.html` and `hacking.html` in the source root.

The following applications are kept up to date as soon as possible.
Others may be updated sooner if a major security problem occurs
(Firefox, Thunderbird etc.)

 
- Tor (stable releases only) 
- TorK 
- Vidalia 
- Polipo 
- Mixminion

Remaining applications, including the base system, will be updated to
whatever Portage deems is stable in each new release. It takes a long
time to compile everything from scratch and sometimes there are
problems that need to be addressed. Most of the packages are marked
stable by Gentoo so there are not many problems.

### 3\.10 Caveats

UDP is a problem. The Tor network does not support UDP yet, only TCP.
Outgoing UDP packets are dropped altogether by netfilter for this
reason.

When using a USB drive your user settings are stored on the drive
unsecured. If any personal information is stored by the applications
you use then you must keep your drive secure from potential threats,
for example by using the optional encryption and a strong passphrase.
