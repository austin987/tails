Tor does not support UDP so we cannot simply redirect DNS queries to
the Tor transparent proxy.

Most DNS leaks are avoided by having the system resolver query
the Tor network using the `DNSPort` configured in
`torrc`.

There is a concern that any application could attempt to do its own
DNS resolution without using the system resolver; UDP datagrams are
therefore blocked in order to prevent leaks. Another solution may be
to use the Linux network filter to forward outgoing UDP datagrams to
the local DNS proxy.

Tails also forbids DNS queries to RFC1918 addresses; those might
indeed allow the system to learn the local network's public IP
address.

`resolv.conf` is configured to point to the Tor DNS resolver, and <span
class="application">NetworkManager<span> and `dhclient` are configured
not to manage `resolv.conf` at all:

* [[!tails_gitweb config/chroot_local-includes/etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/dns.conf]]
* [[!tails_gitweb config/chroot_local-includes/etc/dhcp/dhclient-enter-hooks.d/disable_make_resolv_conf]]
* [[!tails_gitweb config/chroot_local-includes/etc/resolv.conf]]
* [[!tails_gitweb config/chroot_local-includes/etc/tor/torrc]]

Some applications need to be able to do clearnet DNS resolutions, so
we save the DNS configuration obtained by NetworkManager:

* [[!tails_gitweb config/chroot_local-includes/etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/00-resolv-over-clearnet]]

The following is the complete list of the applications allowed to use
the clearnet DNS configuration:

* the `tor` process itself, but only if the user requested to
  configure Tor's network settings in Tails Greeter; in this case
  `tor` being able to resolve hostnames is convenient (e.g. hostnames
  are human-readable, IP addresses not as much) or even necessary
  (e.g. for the Meek pluggable transport):
  - [[!tails_gitweb config/chroot_local-includes/etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/10-tor.sh]]
* the `clearnet` user used to run the
  [[contribute/design/Unsafe_Browser]]:
  - [[!tails_gitweb config/chroot_local-includes/usr/local/sbin/unsafe-browser]]
