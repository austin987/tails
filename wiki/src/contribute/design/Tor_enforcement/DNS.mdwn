Tor does not support UDP so we cannot simply redirect DNS queries to
the Tor transparent proxy.

Most DNS leaks are avoided by having the system resolver query a local
caching DNS server (namely: pdnsd) that in turn performs its DNS
lookups through the Tor network using the `DNSPort` configured in
`torrc`. pdnsd is configured to listen on the loopback interface only;
the single reason for its presence is the improvement of performance
brought by its caching feature.

There is a concern that any application could attempt to do its own
DNS resolution without using the system resolver; UDP datagrams are
therefore blocked in order to prevent leaks. Another solution may be
to use the Linux network filter to forward outgoing UDP datagrams to
the local DNS proxy.

Tails also forbids DNS queries to RFC1918 addresses; those might
indeed allow the system to learn the local network's public IP
address.

[resolvconf](http://alioth.debian.org/projects/resolvconf/) is used to
configure the system resolver in `/etc/resolv.conf`; it is also setup
to prevent NetworkManager and dhcp-client to modify this file.
