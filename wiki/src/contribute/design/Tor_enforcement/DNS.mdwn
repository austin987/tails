Tor does not support UDP so we cannot simply redirect DNS queries to
the Tor transparent proxy.

Most DNS leaks are avoided by having the system resolver query a local
caching DNS server (namely: pdnsd) that in turn performs its DNS
lookups through the Tor network using the `DNSPort` configured in
`torrc`. pdnsd is configured to listen on the loopback interface only;
the single reason for its presence is the improvement of performance
brought by its caching feature.

But the Tor DNS resolver lacks support for most types of DNS queries
except "A", so pdnsd is configured to query the Tor resolver first,
and fallback to [ttdnsd](https://www.torproject.org/ttdnsd/) if the
former fails. ttdnsd forwards incoming UDP DNS requests to a open,
recursive TCP DNS resolver (namely: Google's `8.8.8.8`) via the Tor
SOCKS proxy. Completely replacing the Tor resolver with ttdnsd was
considered, but doing so would give too much power to a single
third-party, that is to the organization or people that runs the
recursive DNS resolver ttdnsd is configured to use.

There is a concern that any application could attempt to do its own
DNS resolution without using the system resolver; UDP datagrams are
therefore blocked in order to prevent leaks. Another solution may be
to use the Linux network filter to forward outgoing UDP datagrams to
the local DNS proxy.

Tails also forbids DNS queries to RFC1918 addresses; those might
indeed allow the system to learn the local network's public IP
address.

[resolvconf](http://alioth.debian.org/projects/resolvconf/) is used to
configure the system resolver in `/etc/resolv.conf`; it is also setup
to prevent NetworkManager and dhcp-client to modify this file.
