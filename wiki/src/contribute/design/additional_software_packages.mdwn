[[!meta title="Additional software packages"]]

[[!toc levels=2]]

Rationale
=========

Tails includes a coherent but limited set of applications. As the system is
amnesic, new software packages for Debian can be installed in a working
session but they are not reinstalled at next reboot.

Additional Software Packages is a feature to remember a set of Debian Packages
to be installed automatically from [[persistent
storage|contribute/design/persistence]] each time Tails is started.

Use cases
=========

Alice is a geographer working for an NGO in an unstable country. They need
to use Tails but needs the QGis SIG to work. It would make little sense
to add such a specific software in Tails. But thanks to Additional
Software Packages, Alice can have QGis installed every time when they boot
Tails with persistent storage enabled.

Bob is a journalist and wants to publish videos made by other
colleagues. Bob needs to convert these videos and is used to the open
source video transcoder HandBrake. With Additional Software Packages,
Bob doesn't need to install it every time when they boot Tails.

Specifications
==============

Goals
-----

- Allow people to choose to:
  - Reinstall a package every time they start Tails.
  - Stop reinstalling a package every time on boot.

- Integrate this in:
  - The usual installation and removal process of a package (through
    Synaptic, another graphical tool, or APT on the command line).
  - The persistent storage configuration.

- Ensure packages are installed even offline.

- Ensure packages are updated when the machine is connected to the Internet.

Non-goals
---------

- We won't support installing software that is not in Debian's official
  repositories.

- We won't provide a way for people to specify which packages to install
  outside of the usual installation process of a package. We only ask
  people if they want to reinstall a package every time *after it has
  been successfully installed a first time*.

Implementation
==============

Software installation at startup
--------------------------------

The systemd user unit
[[!tails_gitweb config/chroot_local-includes/usr/lib/systemd/user/tails-additional-software-install.service]]
is triggered by `desktop.target`. It starts the system unit
[[!tails_gitweb config/chroot_local-includes/lib/systemd/system/tails-additional-software-install.service]]
with sudo (see
[[!tails_gitweb config/chroot_local-includes/etc/sudoers.d/zzz_tails-additional-software]]).

`tails-additional-software-install.service` starts if its configuration exists and executes
[[!tails_gitweb config/chroot_local-includes/usr/local/sbin/tails-additional-software]]
 `install` then creates `/run/live-additional-software/installed`.

`tails-additional-software install` reads `live-additional-software.conf` which
contains a package name per line and install these packages with `apt-get`
(using options that prevent questions being asked to the user, see
`install_additional_packages` and `_launch_apt_get` in
[[!tails_gitweb config/chroot_local-includes/usr/local/sbin/tails-additional-software]]).

In the beginning of the process, the user is notified through desktop
notifications that additional software is being installed:

<img src="https://git.tails.boum.org/ux/plain/additional software/png/notification - installing.png"/>

In the end, they are informed of success of failure. In the latter case, they are
offered to open a configuration window or to examine the logs in order to better
understand the issue. The notifications with buttons displayed are as the desktop
user and are implemented in
[[!tails_gitweb config/chroot_local-includes/usr/local/lib/tails-additional-software-notify]].

<img src="https://git.tails.boum.org/ux/plain/additional software/png/notification - installation failed.png"/>


Software upgrade on Internet connection
---------------------------------------

A network-manager dispatcher hook starts the systemd unit
[[!tails_gitweb config/chroot_local-includes/lib/systemd/system/tails-additional-software-upgrade.path]]
which waits for `/run/live-additional-software/installed` then starts the
oneshot service `/usr/local/sbin/tails-additional-software upgrade` after
`tails-wait-until-tor-has-bootstrapped.service` and `tails-additional-software-install.service`
if the configuration file
`/live/persistence/TailsData_unlocked/live-additional-software.conf` is not
empty.

[[!tails_gitweb config/chroot_local-includes/usr/local/sbin/tails-additional-software]]
`update` saves a copy of apt lists, then starts `apt-get update` and launches the
installation process again, triggering an upgrade if necessary.

If the upgrade is successful, the copy of old apt lists is deleted.
Else, it would be restored by the installation process next time Tails
is started, ensuring that a network disconnection or another unexpected
issue doesn't make the Additional Software Packages unavailable.

In the beginning of the process, the user is notified via desktop
notifications that additional software is being upgraded.

In the end, they are informed of success of failure. In the latter case,
they are offered to open a configuration window or to examine the logs
in order to better understand the issue.

User interface for addition and removal of software
---------------------------------------------------

When the user installs a package either through the APT command line or
a graphical interface like Synaptic, a notification is displayed to let
them add or remove it from their list of additional software.

Two APT hooks are configured in
[[!tails_gitweb config/chroot_local-includes/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/80tails-additional-software.disabled]],
which are enabled by
[[!tails_gitweb config/chroot_local-hooks/99-zz-install-ASP-DPKG-hooks]] in the
end of the build process.

The first hook `DPkg::Pre-Install-Pkgs` runs before any actual
installation happens and calls
`/usr/local/sbin/tails-additional-software apt-pre` which saves a list
of installed and removed packages as JSON in
`/run/live-additional-software/packages`.

The second hook `DPkg::Post-Invoke` runs in the end of the installation
process and calls `/usr/local/sbin/tails-additional-software apt-post`.
It double forks so that APT properly returns, then parses the JSON file
written beforehand in order to check which packages were manually
installed or removed.

### When a package is installed

<img src="https://redmine.tails.boum.org/code/attachments/download/1925/asp-flow-installed.svg" height="auto" />

#### With persistent storage unlocked:

<img src="https://git.tails.boum.org/ux/plain/additional software/png/notification - add.png"/>

When *Add To Persistent Storage* is clicked,
`/usr/bin/tails-persistence-setup` is started as
`tails-persistence-setup` without a GUI to enable the
`AdditionalSoftware` preset. The new additional packages are then added
atomically to the `live-additional-software.conf` configuration file
(this logic is handled by
<https://git-tails.immerda.ch/pythonlib/plain/tailslib/additionalsoftware.py>)

#### Without persistent storage

<img src="https://git.tails.boum.org/ux/plain/additional software/png/notification - add without persistent storage.png"/>

When *Add To Persistent Storage* is clicked,
`/usr/bin/tails-persistence-setup` is started as
`tails-persistence-setup` with a GUI to lead the user through the process
of creating a persistent storage. The `AdditionalSoftware` preset is
automatically enabled. The new additional packages are then added to the
`live-additional-software.conf` configuration file, which is in this
case mounted to `/media/tails-persistence-setup/TailsData` instead of
`/live/persistence/TailsData_unlocked` (this logic in handled by
<https://git-tails.immerda.ch/pythonlib/plain/tailslib/persistence.py>).

The systemd service
[[!tails_gitweb config/chroot_local-includes/lib/systemd/system/tails-synchronize-data-to-new-persistent-volume-on-shutdown.service]]
is used to synchronize APT data (lists and cached packages) to the newly
created persistent storage on Tails shutdown.

#### With persistent storage locked

No notification is displayed as people who have a persistent storage but
don't unlock it, probably do this only sometimes and for a reason. They
probably otherwise unlock their persistent storage most of the time. If
they install packages with their persistent storage locked, they
probably do it with their persistent storage unlock as well and would
learn about this feature when it's most relevant for them.

#### When it's impossible to have persistent storage

This happens when running from a DVD, virtual machine, or intermediary
Tails.

<img src="https://git.tails.boum.org/ux/plain/additional software/png/notification - impossible persistent storage.png"/>

The state file `/run/live-additional-software/installer-asked` ensures
this notification is only shown once per session, not to bother people
too much.

### When a package is removed

<img src="https://redmine.tails.boum.org/code/attachments/download/1926/asp-flow-removed.svg" height="auto" />

<img src="https://git.tails.boum.org/ux/plain/additional software/png/notification - remove.png"/>

When *Remove* is clicked, the packages are removed atomically from the
`live-additional-software.conf` configuration file (this logic is
handled by
<https://git-tails.immerda.ch/pythonlib/plain/tailslib/additionalsoftware/config.py>).

Additional Software configuration window
----------------------------------------

The list of additional software can be opened from:

- **Applications**&nbsp;▸ **System Tools**&nbsp;▸ **Additional Software**
- **Applications**&nbsp;▸ **Tails**&nbsp;▸ **Additional Software**
- a click on the gear button next to the **Additional
Software** feature in the persistent storage settings

This application is implemented in the following files:

- [[!tails_gitweb config/chroot_local-includes/usr/local/bin/tails-additional-software-config]]
- [[!tails_gitweb config/chroot_local-includes/usr/share/applications/org.boum.tails.additional-software-config.desktop.in]]
- [[!tails_gitweb config/chroot_local-includes/usr/share/tails/additional-software/configuration-window.ui]]

If there is no persistent storage or before any package is added, if the
persistent storage is locked, or if it is impossible to have a persistent
storage (for example, when running from a DVD or a virtual machine) the window
shows an explanation text with appropriate pointers:

<img src="https://git.tails.boum.org/ux/plain/additional software/png/additional software - without persistent storage.png"/>

<img src="https://git.tails.boum.org/ux/plain/additional software/png/additional software - empty.png"/>

<img src="https://git.tails.boum.org/ux/plain/additional software/png/additional software - locked persistent storage.png"/>

<img src="https://git.tails.boum.org/ux/plain/additional software/png/additional software - impossible persistent storage.png"/>

When packages have already been added, the window displays a list of
these Additional Software Packages:

<img src="https://git.tails.boum.org/ux/plain/additional software/png/additional software.png"/>

When clicking on the delete cross, a confirmation dialog is displayed:

<img src="https://git.tails.boum.org/ux/plain/additional software/png/additional software - remove.png"/>

The privileged helper 
[[!tails_gitweb config/chroot_local-includes/usr/local/sbin/tails-additional-software-remove]]
is called through *pkexec* to remove the software from the
`live-additional-software.conf` configuration file (see
[[!tails_gitweb config/chroot_local-includes/usr/share/polkit-1/actions/org.boum.tails.additional-software.policy]]
