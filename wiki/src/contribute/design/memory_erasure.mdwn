[[!meta title="Memory erasure"]]

In order to protect against memory recovery such as cold boot attack,
the system RAM is overwritten when Tails is being shutdown or when the
boot medium is physically removed.

#### The big picture

The previous implementation of the Tails memory erasure feature
suffered from flaws that were demonstrated by [[external
audit|security/audits/Blackhat_De-Anonymizing_Live_CDs]]. In short, it
only erased free memory and let data in the aufs read-write branch in
recoverable state.

In order to erase the biggest possible part of the system memory, the
hereby described new implementation, shipped in Tails 0.7, runs in a
fresh environment provided by a newly started Linux kernel. This way,
a given part of the memory either is *used* by the memory erasure
process itself or it is considered as free and thus *erased* by this
process; in any case, it is at least overwritten once.

#### initramfs tweaks

The Linux kernel and initramfs used to erase the memory are the same
as the ones normally used by a Tails system... that actually includes
some bits of code dedicated to this mission.

An initramfs-tools hook includes the necessary files in the initramfs
at build time. A runtime init-premount script either does nothing, or
erases memory before shutting down or rebooting the system; its
behaviour depends on the `sdmem` kernel command line parameter value.
Additionally, the `sdmemopts` kernel command line parameter allows
fine tuning the options passed to the `sdmem` program.

- [[!tails_gitweb config/chroot_local-includes/usr/share/initramfs-tools/scripts/init-premount/sdmem]]

These `sdmem` and `sdmemopts` are appended to the fresh kernel command
line parameters, when memory erasure is triggered, by the
`tails-kexec` initscript that is itself parameterized by the usual,
slightly customized, kexec-tools configuration file.

#### Actual memory erasure process

The software that performs the actual memory erasure is sdmem, which
is part of the [secure-delete](http://www.thc.org/) package. sdmem is
called using the `-v` (verbose mode) option to give feedback to the
user, as well as the `-llf` options: memory is only overwritten once
with zeros; this is the fastest available mode, and is enough to
protect against every memory forensics attack we know of.

#### Triggers

Different kinds of events trigger the memory erasure process. All lead
to run the `tails-kexec` initscript.

**First, the memory erasure process is triggered at the end of a normal
shutdown/reboot sequence.** This is implemented by slightly modifying
the System V initscripts shipped by the `kexec-tools` Debian package:
the `kexec-load` initscript, that normally only runs at reboot time,
is enabled to run at shutdown time as well. A custom `tails-kexec`
initscript replaces the `kexec` one in order to support the case when
the boot medium is not available anymore at the time this script runs;
it also provides an improved user interface more suitable for Tails
target users needs. Finally, the standard Debian `halt` and `reboot`
initscripts are taken over by having the `tails-kexec` initscript run
before they have a chance to be run (implemented with `Required-Stop`
in the LSB headers).

- [[!tails_gitweb config/chroot_local-includes/etc/init.d/tails-kexec]]
- [[!tails_gitweb config/chroot_local-hooks/52-update-rc.d]]

**Second, the memory erasure process is triggered when the boot medium
is physically removed during runtime (USB boot medium is unplugged or
boot DVD is ejected).** This is implemented by a custom `udev-watchdog`
program monitors the boot medium; it's run by a wrapper, started at
boot time, that brutally invokes the memory erasure process, bypassing
other system shutdown scripts, when this medium happens to be
physically removed.

#### Making sure needed files are available

The `memlockd` daemon, appropriately configured, ensures every file
needed by the memory erasure process is locked into memory from boot
to memory erasure time.

Care have to be taken during the shutdown sequence, as `memlockd` is normally
unloaded before the `kexec` happens. This is done by preventing `memlockd` to
be stopped, and also by adding memlockd PID to the list of process that are
omitted by the `sendsigs` script (responsible for sending TERM and KILL signals
to remaining processes).

- [[!tails_gitweb config/chroot_local-patches/keep_memlockd_on_shutdown.diff]]
- [[!tails_gitweb config/chroot_local-includes/etc/init.d/tails-reconfigure-memlockd]]

#### User interface

Since this process can take a while the user can leave the computer
and let it finish on its own after removing the boot medium, or simply
turn it off if he or she is not worried about this attack: if Tails
was booted from a DVD it is ejected before the memory wiping is
started, and if it was booted from a USB drive it can be removed as
soon as the memory wiping has been started.

A short but visible message, displayed for a few seconds, explains the
user what is going to happen.
