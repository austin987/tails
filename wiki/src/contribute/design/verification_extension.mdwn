[[!meta title="Tails Verification (browser extension)"]]

Software verification is a critical step in the use of secure
applications but it has traditionally been hard to provide, especially
from a user perspective. Usual solutions are:

  - Using HTTPS to download. But in the case of Tails, we are serving so
    many downloads that we have to rely on [[mirrors hosted by third
    parties|contribute/design/mirrors]]. HTTPS also doesn't protect from interrupted downloads leading to
    broken Tails installations.
  - Providing OpenPGP signatures. But this really works only for the few
    people who know how to verify an OpenPGP signature and use the
    OpenPGP Web-of-Trust correctly.

We are trying here to provide a usable solution to verify a download
done through HTTP, while relying on cryptographic information fetched
elsewhere through HTTPS (and possibly with stronger authentication
mechanisms such as public key pinning from browser vendors).

We use for that a browser extension, called
*Tails Verification* which is available for:

* Firefox 45+ (and Tor Browser 6+)
* Chrome 22+

The code of *Tails Verification* is available in `git clone https://git-tails.immerda.ch/verification-extension`.

Scope
=====

Goals
-----

Provide a simple, automated, and cross-platform technique to verify the ISO
image of the current version.

Non goals
---------

  - Verify deprecated ISO images.
  - Verify ISO images downloaded from nightly.tails.boum.org.
  - Verify ISO images downloaded through BitTorrent. If we can rely on
    our website to provide a correct cryptographic description of the
    ISO image then we can rely on it as well to provide a correct
    BitTorrent file. Then we rely on the BitTorrent client to verify the integrity of
    the download ([[!tails_ticket 9043]]).

Security considerations
=======================

<a id="threat_model"></a>

Threat model
------------

We are considering here an attacker who can:

  - [A] Provide a malicious ISO image to the user for example by
    operating a rogue Tails mirror.

  - [H] Operate a website that is loaded in a different tab in the same
    browser as the extension. See the section on [[security inside the
    browser|verification_extension#inside_the_browser]].

We are not considering an attacker who can:

  - [B] Do a man-in-the-middle attack by providing a rogue HTTPS certificate
    for https://tails.boum.org/ signed by a certificate authority
    trusted by the
    browser but under the control of the attacker.

    Since the extension is targeted at new users, a MitM or exploit on
    our website could defeat any verification technique by providing
    simplified instructions or by faking ISO verification.

    Note that our website is already in the HSTS preload list of Firefox
    and Chrome which forces HTTPS connections to our website, even for
    first time visitors.

  - [C] Insert malicious content on https://tails.boum.org/ through an
    exploit on our website as this could trick new users to skip the ISO
    verification all the way. To prevent this kind of attack we should
    instead:

    - Monitor externally the most relevant parts of our website.
    - Work on integrating full upgrades in Tails Upgrader to limit the
      number of times people have to rely on our website to upgrade. See
      [[!tails_ticket 7499]].

  - [D] Insert malicious information in our main Git repository as such
    an attacker could do attack [C] as well.

  - [E] Insert targeted malware on the user's computer as this could
    defeat any possible verification mechanism that such an extension
    could do.

  - [F] Provide a rogue extension to the user as this could defeat any
    possible verification mechanism that such an extension could do.

  - [G] Insert malicious content on https://tails.boum.org/ after taking
    control of the web server, or entire system, behind it. Such an
    attacker could do attack [C] as well but in such a way that could be
    much harder to detect (for example by serving malicious content only to
    some users).

    To mitigate such an attack in some cases we could both:

    - Encourage external documentation (screencasts on YouTube, printed
      forms, etc.). But those would be vulnerable to other kind of
      attacks.
    - Not rely on the website to perform the ISO verification and rely
      on a native interface accessible from the add-ons menu.

    But the cost/benefit of such a technique is not very appealing…

  - [I] Provide a malicious extension in the same browser as this would
    have similar effects to attack [F].

<a id="inside_the_browser"></a>

Security inside the browser
---------------------------

The threat described as [H] is taken care of by the internals of the
browser (and the proper coding of the extension).

### Cross-origin communication

The extension uses cross-origin communication to modify the download
page.

- To ensure that messages from the extension are only sent to pages on
  our website, the extension
  sets `targetOrigin` to `https://tails.boum.org` (no trailing slash needed) in
  [`postMessage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage).
  See commit c87ce92.

- Before processing the message, the download page verifies that it is
  coming from:

  - The same tab (`event.source` is `window`)
  - Our website (`event.origin` is `https://tails.boum.org`, no trailing slash needed)

  See [[!tails_gitweb wiki/src/install/inc/js/download.js
  desc="`receiveMessage()` in *download.js*"]].

- The code of the extension is only injected in tabs on
  `https://tails.boum.org/` (with a trailing slash). See `permissions`
  in *manifest.js* and `matches` in *scripts/background/background.js*.

- The communication is unidirectional: only the extension sends messages
  and the extension does not listen to messages.

### Content Security Policy

Instead of the default Content Security Policy, the extension uses the
strictest policy: `default-src 'none'`.

<a id="update"></a>

Updates mechanism
-----------------

### Automatic update from browsers

- Chrome checks for updates "[every few
  hours](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/autoupdate)".
- Firefox checks for updates once per day.
- Tor Browser doesn't prevent those updates [except for Torbutton and
  Tor Launcher](https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tbb-dev/2015-April/000258.html).

### Enforce version check on our download page

On top of this, the HTML code of our download page includes a tag to
force a version of the extension. For example:

<pre>
&lt;div id="extension-version"&gt;1.0&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>

*Tails Verification* checks the value of this tag and asks for an
update if its version is lower than the requested version number.

This mechanism might be useful to force updated extensions with a finer
time granularity that the native automatic updates from the browsers.

Functioning
===========

Extension technology
--------------------

The extension is written as a *Web Extension* and the same exact code
works on both Firefox and Chrome.
<a id="data_source">

Data source
-----------

Building up on the format specified for [[upgrade description
files|contribute/design/incremental_upgrades#upgrade-description-files]],
the verification extension fetches an [[!tails_gitweb wiki/src/install/v1/Tails/i386/stable/latest.yml desc="ISO description file"]] from our
server to retrieve all the information it needs about the ISO image
(URL, size, checksum, etc.). As a beginning, this ISO description file
is not signed using OpenPGP.

### Example of an ISO description file

    ---
    build-target: i386
    channel: stable
    product-name: Tails
    version: '0.23'
    target-files:
    - sha256: 359d104737f1a448375d2030f938dea3d529468b8218485998ab893c1f7509eb
      size: 939571200
      url: http://dl.amnesia.boum.org/tails/stable/tails-i386-0.23/tails-i386-0.23.iso

Checksum verification
---------------------

When verifying an ISO image, the extension:

  - Downloads the ISO description document (size, checksum) from:

    <https://tails.boum.org/v1/Tails/amd64/stable/latest.yml>

  - Verifies the ISO image against the document (first its size, then
    its checksum).

Security properties:

  - This technique would defeat attack [A] (malicious ISO).

More complex verification mechanisms could be gradually [[built into
Tails Installer|blueprint/bootstrapping/installer]] where we can
defeat attacks [B], [C], [D], [F], and [G].

Embedded *Forge* library
------------------------

Contrary to its predecessor
([DAVE](https://git-tails.immerda.ch/download-and-verify-extension)),
*Tails Verification* cannot rely on native API calls to calculate the
checksum. So it embeds the *Forge* library:

<https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/>

We choose *Forge* because it was reported as being the fastest in this
benchmark:

<https://github.com/brillout/test-javascript-hash-implementations>

<a id="html">

Manipulation of the download page
---------------------------------

The extension modifies what is displayed on the page using two different
mechanisms:

- Mostly through message communication (`postMessage`) sent to a
  script on the page ([[!tails_gitweb wiki/src/install/inc/js/download.js]]).

- If an extension is already installed when the page is loaded, through
  an HTML attribute (`documentElement.dataset.extension`) corresponding
  to some CSS declarations, to indicate whether the extension is
  up-to-date or outdated.

- If the extension gets installed on a page, through a background script
  that injects the JavaScript of the extension on the page. See commit
  d80b322.

This decouples the code of the extension from the implementation of the
display on the HTML page (ids, classes, etc.).

When JavaScript is disabled, the page instructs the user to temporarily
allow JavaScript on the page (through NoScript, the most likely scenario):

[[!img install/inc/screenshots/allow_js.png link="no"]]

They can otherwise still download using BitTorrent.
