[[!meta title="Installation Assistant"]]

In 2015, we worked on a complete rewrite on our installation
instructions. The archive of our design process as well as pending
issues can be found in the [[corresponding
blueprint|blueprint/bootstrapping/assistant]].

Our previous instructions forced people to jump through many different
documentation pages and often to figure out by themselves what to do next. See
this [[flowchart of the installation process as of
2014|blueprint/bootstrapping/2014.fodg]].

The objective was to make this a linear process, to be follow step-by-step, and
that would take the user from our homepage up to starting on a Tails USB stick
with a persistent volume. But this process has to be adapted to the base
operating system of the user or their technical expertise.

We decided to optimize it for first time and less technical users, while still
being usable by expert users.

The following scenarios are proposed:

  - [[Install from another Tails (for PC)|install/win/clone/overview]]
  - [[Install from another Tails (for Mac)|install/mac/clone/overview]]
  - [[Install from Windows|install/win/usb/overview]]
  - [[Install from Debian, Ubuntu, or Mint|install/debian/usb/overview]]
  - [[Install from Debian, Ubuntu, or Mint using the command line and GnuPG|install/expert/usb/overview]]
  - [[Install from other Linux distributions|install/linux/usb/overview]]
  - [[Install from Mac OS X by burning a DVD first|install/mac/dvd/overview]]
  - [[Install from Mac OS X and the command line|install/mac/usb/overview]]
  - [[Burn a DVD|install/dvd]]
  - [[Download without installing|install/download]]
  - [[Download and verify using OpenPGP|install/download/openpgp]]

The installation assistant is also adapted to cover two [[manual upgrade
scenarios|upgrade]]:

  - [[Upgrade from another Tails|upgrade/clone/overview]]
  - [[Upgrade inside Tails|upgrade/tails/overview]]

The assistant is divided into three sections:

  - The [[*router*|ia#router]] which selects the scenario to follow.
  - The [[*overview*|ia#overview]] which summarizes graphically the scenario.
  - The [[*steps*|ia#steps]] which gives step-by-step instructions for the scenario.

Implementation tricks
---------------------

The installation assistant is basically presenting very similar content in many
different scenarios with small variations (slightly different steps, slightly
different terminology, etc.).

To reuse as much content as possible and reduce the quantity of text and
translations, our implementation relies heavily on two tricks. Both are
quite hackish but were the only solution we found to avoid duplicating
massive amount of content in ikiwiki.

### Ikiwiki inlines

The [inline directive](https://ikiwiki.info/ikiwiki/directive/inline/) of
ikiwiki allows embedding a file into another file to avoid duplicating content.
It is quite limited and brittle, especially when used together with the PO
plugin. See [[!tails_ticket 6907]]. Many inlines also slow down the build
process quite a lot.

### Conditional CSS content

To adapt a piece of content reused using ikiwiki inlines to the context
where it appears we are using CSS classes. For example, to introduce the
program used to install an intermediary Tails on Windows and Linux we
wrote:

<pre>
&lt;span class="windows"&gt;a program called Universal USB Installe.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="linux"&gt;a program called GNOME Disks.&lt;/span&gt;
</pre>

The `windows` class being only displayed in the Windows scenario and the
`linux` class being only displayed in the Linux scenario.

<a id="#router"></a>

Router
------

The *router* is a sequence of multiple choices that determines which
installation scenario to follow. It is divided by operating systems:

  - Windows
  - Mac OS X
  - Linux with `APT` and `tails-installer`: Debian, Ubuntu, or Mint
  - Other Linux distributions

But we still propose cloning as an alternative as it is easier and
faster.

- *Download only* is proposed as a minor option on the first page of the
  router. This is an example of us optimizing for first time users: installing
  Tails is very complex and we really want them to follow the full installation
  instructions and not only download and try to figure out the rest by
  themselves. This is especially true for those who think they are power users
  which is a good share of our audience.

  *Download only* is not offered as an option from the
  sidebar of the website for the same reason and to keep the sidebar as
  simple as possible.

- Burning a DVD is also proposed as a minor option because:
  - DVD are not very popular (13% of the WhisperBack reports received in
    2015).
  - DVD do not benefit from automatic upgrades, so people might be more
    quickly out-of-date.
  - DVD does not allow creating a persistent volume, so people cannot
    rely on long lasting cryptographic keys to secure their
    communication and might use weaker techniques.
  - For these same reasons we only provide a download and links to Ubuntu
    instructions in the scenario.

- Running in a virtual machine is proposed as a minor option because:
  - VMs are not very popular (5% of the WhisperBack reports received in
    2015).
  - VMs are less secure because the host operating system can monitor
    them.
  - VMs make it harder to create a persistent volume, so people might
    not rely on long lasting cryptographic keys to secure their
    communication and might use weaker techniques.
  - For these same reasons we only provide a download and inline the
    documentation on virtualization in the scenario.

<a id="overview"></a>

Overview
--------

The *overview* is a single page summarizing graphically:

  - The requirements of the installation scenario in terms of hardware
    and time. This is important so that people get ready and make sure
    beforehand that they have everything needed to complete the
    scenario.
  - The different steps. This give a rough idea of what will happen
    next and how complex it is. This is particularly important as the
    *steps* are a single and very long page.

For example, the content of the overview for installing from Debian is
stored in `debian/usb/overview.html` which includes a common block of
HTML stored in `install/inc/overview.html` and uses the `debian` CSS
class to adapt to the scenario.

  - Classes potentially displayed on different pages:
    - `clone` for content involving cloning
    - `usb` for content with a USB stick as destination device
    - `windows` for content for Windows 
    - `mac` for content for Mac OS X
    - `debian` for content for Debian, Ubuntu, or Mint
    - `expert` for content for Debian, Ubuntu, or Mint on the command line
    - `linux` for content for other Linux
    - `upgrade` for content for manual upgrade
  - Classes displayed only on one page:
    - `dvd` for [[/install/dvd|/install/dvd]]
    - `vm` for [[/install/vm|/install/vm]]
    - `download-only` for [[/install/download|/install/download]]
    - `install-clone` for [[/install/clone|/install/clone]]
    - `windows-usb` for [[/install/win/usb|/install/win/usb]]
    - `mac-usb` for [[/install/mac/usb|/install/mac/usb]]
    - `mac-dvd` for [[/install/mac/dvd|/install/mac/dvd]]
    - `mac-clone` for [[/install/mac/clone|/install/mac/clone]]
    - `debian-usb` for [[/install/debian/usb|/install/debian/usb]]
    - `expert-usb` for [[/install|/install]]
    - `linux-usb` for [[/install/linux/usb|/install/linux/usb]]
    - `upgrade-clone` for [[/upgrade/clone|/upgrade/clone]]
    - `upgrade-tails` for [[/upgrade/tails|/upgrade/tails]]

<a id="steps"></a>

Steps
-----

The *steps* for a given scenario is a very long page with step-by-step
instructions of the whole process. 

- It is a single page so that people can get a feeling of what is left
  to be done. During the tests, many people were scrolling up and down
  the page, for example while waiting for an operation to complete or
  when feeling that they missed something earlier.

- The [[download of the ISO image|ia#download]] is integrated as one of these steps.

- The content of each step is written in an inline stored in
  `install/inc/steps/*.inline.mdwn` which is inlined from the scenarios
  themselves (for example `install/debian/usb.mdwn`) and adapted to each
  scenario using CSS classes.

<a id="download"></a>

Downloading techniques
----------------------

The download of the ISO image is integrated as one of the steps in the scenario
(but the download step only is also available as a [[standalone
page|install/download]]).

We propose three download techniques, each of them corresponding to a technique
to verify the ISO image, to a level of authenticity at least as good as HTTPS:

1. A Firefox extension, called DAVE. See the [[dedicated design
   document|dave]] for a security analysis of this technique.

1. A BitTorrent download. The Torrent file is downloaded through HTTPS
   and BitTorrent clients automatically verifies the download once
   completed.
   - In Firefox, this technique is presented as a minor option.
   - In other browser, this technique is presented with equal weight as the
     Firefox extension.

1. A direct download together with instructions to verify it using
   OpenPGP, the signing key being downloaded over HTTPS. We assume that
   this technique is only relevant for people who are already knowledgeable
   about OpenPGP. As a consequence:

   - For people in Debian and who feel confident with OpenPGP and the command
     line, we advertise it as a dedicated scenario that leads them through a
     verification of the signing key through the Debian keyring.

   - For all the others, we offer it as a minor option, for example with equal
     weight as BitTorrent for people who are running Firefox and then:
     - We only provide simplified instructions on how to perform the
       verification, insisting on aspects that might still be relevant for
       this public: verification of the date, command line options,
       warning when the signing key is not trusted, etc.
     - We take more time to develop the verification of the signing key
       through the OpenPGP Web of Trust.

As a consequence, we don't provide a preeminent direct download link for
everybody and are somehow *forcing* people to verify the ISO image. Some
criticized this as a [dark pattern](http://darkpatterns.org/) but we genuinely
believe that it is in the interest of the user to make it easier to verify the
ISO image than to not verify it, as it:

  - Provides more secure downloads.
  - Detects uncompleted downloads that can lead to much trouble down the
    roadmap, and the corresponding load on our help desk.
