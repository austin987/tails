Warn users when running inside a VM
===================================

We tell users, when running inside a VM, that they are implicitly
trusting both the VM software *and* the host OS; the warning message
points to a [[dedicated documentation page|doc/advanced_topics/virtualization]].
This is needed to avoid creating a false sense of security, which is
often worse than no security and a clear sense of it.

The detection is done at boot time with
[virt-what](http://packages.qa.debian.org/v/virt-what.html). Detection
results are stored in `/var/lib/live/detected-virtual-machine` and
later used by a desktop notification system.
