[[!meta title="Tor network configuration"]]

# Rationale

Certain networks are restricted in ways that prevent Tor from
connecting properly without further configuration. Examples are:

* Egress port filtering (solved with `ReachableAddresses`).

* The Internet is only reachable via a proxy (solved with the `*Proxy`
  options).

* Tor is explicitly blocked (the Tor people like the term "censored"),
  which can be circumvented by using Tor bridges (solved with
  `UseBridges`, `Bridge`, and possibly `ClientTransportPlugin`).

In addition, bridges can be used to obfuscate Tor's traffic so that it
becomes harder for adversaries to identify Tor usage, especially in
combination with pluggable transports. This makes Tor (and hence
Tails) safer to use in regions where it's dangerous for some reason,
or in other situations where users want to hide that they use Tor. In
Tails we think this is a highly useful use case of Tor bridges beyond
its more publicly announced "censorship circumvention" usage.

In Tails we need a user-friendly and safe way for users to configure
these options before Tor tries to connect to the public Tor network.

# Implementation

In Tails Greeter the "Network Configuration" section contains a
non-default option called "My Internet Connection is
censored...". When activated, the following deviations from normal
Tails behaviour occur, in order:

1. Tails Greeter adds `DisableNetwork 1` to torrc so Tor will not
   connect to the network without user intervention.

2. When we connect to the network, a NetworkManager hook starts Tor
   Launcher in the background, i.e. non-blocking.

3. [[Time_syncing]] waits until the user has committed their
   configuration via Tor Launcher and then does its usual magic to
   ensure that Tor bootstraps even if the clock was incorrect. That is
   the reason why we have to take the more complex approach of
   starting Tor Launcher in parallel.

We install Tor Launcher by extracting it from the Tor Browser tarball,
when building the ISO image.

Scripts:

* [[!tails_gitweb config/chroot_local-hooks/10-tbb]] (installs Tor Launcher)

* [[!tails_gitweb config/chroot_local-includes/usr/local/sbin/tails-tor-launcher]]
  (Wrapper for Tor Launcher)

* [[!greeter_gitweb PostLogin.default]] (sets `DisableNetwork`)

* [[!tails_gitweb config/chroot_local-includes/etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/10-tor.sh]]
  (Tor Launcher is started here)

* [[!tails_gitweb config/chroot_local-includes/etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/20-time.sh]]
  (Time syncing)
