  and then later on more frontdesk also working on the weblate server
  that is a bit flaky since update

  - Availability: Full until August 16, then I'll be travelling in
    sprint and meetings.

Chapter 4: [[Derya, the privacy advocate|blueprint/personas#derya]]

- Doing stuff for (untrusted) others
  - *emmapeel: i think derya would like to be able to format suspicious
    USB stick people gives them*
  - *sajolida: right, Derya is sometimes "doing stuff for people" during
    training and such*

- Refugee status
  - *segfault: "Turkish refugee in Germany" is unrealistic - Germany
    doesn't allow Turkish refugees*
  - *segfault: Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan are countries from which
    refugees are allowed to stay in Germany*
  - *sajolida: i know people living in Germany who were born and raised
    in Turkey and are living now in Germany to be safe (LGBT) but i
    don't know if they have an official "refugee" status*
  - *sajolida: i think we said Derya was Turkish because of the recent
    crackdown on digital security trainers in Turkey and the big Turkish
    community in Germany*
  - *emmapeel: exile?*

- Outreach material
  - *emmapeel: maybe Derya wants to print and make posters, flyers, etc*
  - *sajolida: yeap, i should add more details about his advocacy and
    training work, but it definitely includes sharing printed material*
  - *emmapeel: as an adult because of homphobia? cause it is difficult
    to be gay there?*
  - *segfault: just say that she is Turkish and lives in Germany*

- Training and advocacy
  - *sajolida: i'm realizing now that the training and advocacy of Derya
    looks like the training and advocacy that we added to Riou in July.*
