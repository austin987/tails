BitTorrent
==========

It's really easy to help Tails users downloading it over BitTorrent...
especially if you are already a BitTorrent user.

1. Get the latest BitTorrent files
----------------------------------

Here are the latest available BitTorrent files:

[[!map pages="torrents/files/*.torrent"]]

2. Share Tails images
---------------------

Feed your preferred BitTorrent client with the `.torrent` files
downloaded at the previous step. Make sure you open and/or forward the
needed ports in your router and/or firewall configuration so that you
are a real seed.

3. Stay tuned!
--------------

As a contributor to Tails availability over BitTorrent, it is very
important you share the very latest published version, and only this
one: users need to be able to quickly download it and upgrade when we
release security fixes, and there is no need to help propagate
outdated versions with security flaws.

A way to do this is to configure software to [[automatically download
and seed Tails over
BitTorrent|contribute/how/mirror/automatically_download_and_seed_Tails_over_BitTorrent]].

Else, new versions are announced on:

* our [news
  mailing-list](https://mailman.boum.org/listinfo/amnesia-news)
* our <a href='/torrents/rss/index.rss'>RSS</a> and
  <a href='/torrents/rss/index.atom'>Atom</a> feeds that announce new available
  BitTorrent files.

HTTP
====

To efficiently help Tails users downloading it over HTTP, one needs to
have sufficiently privileged access to a web server with decent
bandwidth: a domestic DSL connection won't help; neither will a shared
web hosting setup that provides FTP access only.

To give you an idea, a few dedicated Mb/s is a must; you must expect
pushing at least 50-100GB [[!wikipedia GiB]] (bytes, not bits) on
a normal day, and twice as much for a short period after each release.
So, it is a must to be able to push at least 2 [[!wikipedia TiB]]
a month, and preferably 3 or 4 TiB.

If you satisfy these practical requirements, please read on!
Else, please consider seeding Tails images over BitTorrent instead.

Before starting doing any real work on this topic, please get in touch
(<tails@boum.org>, [[OpenPGP key|doc/about/openpgp_keys]]) and send us
your OpenPGP public key, so that any further communication between us
can be properly encrypted and authenticated.

1. The big picture
------------------

We have a DNS Round Robin setup for the `dl.amnesia.boum.org` host.

Every HTTP mirror makes our files available under a fixed URL
(`http://dl.amnesia.boum.org/tails/`) that contains per-version
sub-directories (such as
`http://dl.amnesia.boum.org/tails/stable/tails-i386-lenny-0.6.2/`).

2. Set up your web server
-------------------------

You need to set up a virtual host for dl.amnesia.boum.org, with indexing
enabled.

### Apache configuration example

	<VirtualHost YOUR_WEBSERVER_IP:80>
	   ServerName dl.amnesia.boum.org
	   ServerAdmin YOUR_EMAIL
	
	   DocumentRoot /var/www/THE_PLACE_WHERE_YOU_WANT_OUR_FILES_TO_LIVE/
	   <Directory /var/www/THE_PLACE_WHERE_YOU_WANT_OUR_FILES_TO_LIVE/>
	      Options Indexes
	      AllowOverride None
	      IndexIgnore README.html
	      IndexOptions FancyIndexing FoldersFirst IgnoreCase NameWidth=50
	      IndexOrderDefault Descending Date
	   </Directory>
	</VirtualHost>

### Lighttpd configuration example

	$HTTP["host"] =~ "^dl\.amnesia\.boum\.org$" {
		server.document-root = "/var/www/THE_PLACE_WHERE_YOU_WANT_OUR_FILES_TO_LIVE/"
		server.dir-listing = "enable"
	}

### nginx configuration example

	server {
		server_name dl.amnesia.boum.org;
		root /var/www/THE_PLACE_WHERE_YOU_WANT_OUR_FILES_TO_LIVE;
		location / {
			autoindex on;
		}
	}

3. Download the files
---------------------

Download a snapshot of the current Tails files:

	rsync -rt --delete rsync.torproject.org::amnesia-archive \
	         /var/www/THE_PLACE_WHERE_YOU_WANT_OUR_FILES_TO_LIVE/

4. Schedule the pulling of the files
------------------------------------

Secondary mirrors (like yours) should sync every hour + 15 minutes.
Use `cron` or equivalent to schedule the same `rsync` command
as above.

5. Go wild
----------

As soon as your web server is ready, please e-mail us its IP address
so that we can ask the DNS server admins to add it to the Round Robin
pool.
