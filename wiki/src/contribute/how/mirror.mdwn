BitTorrent
==========

It's really easy to help Tails users downloading it over BitTorrent...
especially if you are already a BitTorrent user.

1. Get the latest BitTorrent files
----------------------------------

Here are the latest available BitTorrent files:

[[!map pages="torrents/files/*.torrent"]]

2. Share Tails images
---------------------

Feed your preferred BitTorrent client with the `.torrent` files
downloaded at the previous step. Make sure you open and/or forward the
needed ports in your router and/or firewall configuration so that you
are a real seed.

3. Stay tuned!
--------------

As a contributor to Tails availability over BitTorrent, it is very
important you share the very latest published version, and only this
one: users need to be able to quickly download it and upgrade when we
release security fixes, and there is no need to help propagate
outdated versions with security flaws.

A way to do this is to configure software to [[automatically download
and seed Tails over
BitTorrent|contribute/how/mirror/automatically_download_and_seed_Tails_over_BitTorrent]].

Else, new versions are announced on:

* our [news
  mailing-list](https://mailman.boum.org/listinfo/amnesia-news)
* our <a href='/torrents/rss/index.rss'>RSS</a> and
  <a href='/torrents/rss/index.atom'>Atom</a> feeds that announce new available
  BitTorrent files.

HTTP
====

To efficiently help Tails users downloading it over HTTP, one needs to
have sufficiently privileged access to a web server with decent
bandwidth: a domestic DSL connection won't help; neither will a shared
web hosting setup that provides FTP access only.

To give you an idea, a few dedicated Mb/s is a must; you must expect
pushing at least 50-100GB [[!wikipedia GiB]] (bytes, not bits) on
a normal day, and twice as much for a short period after each release.
So, it is a must to be able to push at least 5 [[!wikipedia TiB]]
a month, and preferably 6 or 8 TiB.

You will also need around 5-10 GiB of disk space.

If you satisfy these practical requirements, please read on!
Else, please consider seeding Tails images over BitTorrent instead.

Before starting doing any real work on this topic, please get in touch
(<tails@boum.org>, [[OpenPGP key|doc/about/openpgp_keys#private]]) and send us
your OpenPGP public key, so that any further communication between us
can be properly encrypted and authenticated.

The big picture
------------------

We have a DNS Round Robin setup for the `dl.amnesia.boum.org` host.

Every HTTP mirror makes our files available under a fixed URL
(`http://dl.amnesia.boum.org/tails/`) that contains per-version
sub-directories (such as
`http://dl.amnesia.boum.org/tails/stable/tails-i386-lenny-0.6.2/`).

<div class="tip">
If you are using [[!wikipedia Puppet_(software) desc="Puppet"]] to configure
your server infrastructure, consider using the available [[HTTP mirror Puppet
module|mirror#http-puppet]].
</div>

Manual set up
-------------------------

### 1. Set up your web server

You need to set up a virtual host for dl.amnesia.boum.org, with indexing
enabled and [[!wikipedia HTTP_ETag desc="ETags"]] disabled.

#### Apache configuration example

	<VirtualHost YOUR_WEBSERVER_IP:80>
	   ServerName dl.amnesia.boum.org
	   ServerAdmin YOUR_EMAIL
	
	   DocumentRoot /var/www/THE_PLACE_WHERE_YOU_WANT_OUR_FILES_TO_LIVE/
	   <Directory /var/www/THE_PLACE_WHERE_YOU_WANT_OUR_FILES_TO_LIVE/>
	      Options Indexes
	      FileETag None
	      AllowOverride None
	      IndexIgnore README.html
	      IndexOptions FancyIndexing FoldersFirst IgnoreCase NameWidth=50
	      IndexOrderDefault Descending Date
	   </Directory>
	</VirtualHost>

#### Lighttpd configuration example

	static-file.etags = "disable"
	$HTTP["host"] =~ "^dl\.amnesia\.boum\.org$" {
		server.document-root = "/var/www/THE_PLACE_WHERE_YOU_WANT_OUR_FILES_TO_LIVE/"
		server.dir-listing = "enable"
	}

#### nginx configuration example

	server {
		server_name dl.amnesia.boum.org;
		etag off;
		root /var/www/THE_PLACE_WHERE_YOU_WANT_OUR_FILES_TO_LIVE;
		location / {
			autoindex on;
		}
	}

### 2. Download the files

Download a snapshot of the current Tails files:

	rsync -rt --delete \
	         rsync.torproject.org::amnesia-archive \
	         /var/www/THE_PLACE_WHERE_YOU_WANT_OUR_FILES_TO_LIVE/

If you have disk space limitations, you might want to exclude the
`/tails/obsolete` folder (which contains old versions of Tails) from the
download:

	rsync -rt --delete --exclude=/tails/obsolete --delete-excluded \
	         rsync.torproject.org::amnesia-archive \
	         /var/www/THE_PLACE_WHERE_YOU_WANT_OUR_FILES_TO_LIVE/

### 3. Schedule the pulling of the files

Secondary mirrors (like yours) should sync every hour + 15 minutes.
Use `cron` or equivalent to schedule the same `rsync` command
as above.

You can now [[ask for your mirror to be added to the pool|mirror#http-pool]].

Set up with Puppet
-----------------

It is assumed that Puppet is already installed and configured to function well
for your infrastructure.

### 1. Clone the `tails` Puppet module

Clone the module inside the puppet modules' directory of your puppetmaster. On
Debian, this directory should be `/etc/puppet/modules`.

     git clone https://git-tails.immerda.ch/puppet-tails /etc/puppet/modules/tails

### 2. Use the tails::mirror class

On a node where you wish setup the mirror you should include the class like

     include tails::mirror

If you need to adjust any parameters of the class, you should declare it like

     class { 'tails::mirror':
       webserver   => 'apache2',
       mirror_path => '/srv/tails/mirror',
     }

#### Configurable parameters

 * `webserver`, specifies webserver software, 'nginx' or 'apache2', defaults to
   'nginx'
 * `package`, specifies the debian package name for the webserver, defaults to
   `webserver` value
 * `mirror_path`, specifies the directory where mirror's data will be located,
   defaults to '/var/www/tails-mirror/'
 * `access_log`, specifies webserver's access log file path, defaults to
   '/dev/null'
 * `error_log`, specifies webserver's error log file path, defaults to
   '/dev/null'

Go wild
----------

As soon as your web server is ready, please e-mail us its IP address
so that we can ask the DNS server admins to add it to the Round Robin
pool.
