# Known tasks

We have identified some things that we would like to see improved on
our website: see the [website-related
tasks](https://redmine.tails.boum.org/code/projects/tails/issues?query_id=115)
on Redmine.

# Other ideas

Nevertheless, if you are a web or graphics person, you can surely
find other ideas to improve the Tails website! Even if you don't plan
to implement every suggested enhancement yourself, it may be worth
[creating
tickets](https://redmine.tails.boum.org/code/projects/tails/issues/new) with
your ideas so that others can benefit from your insight.

# Working on the website

The website [[https://tails.boum.org/]] is built using
[Ikiwiki](https://ikiwiki.info) from source code that is available in
our main Git repository, along with the rest of the Tails code.

You can build a local copy of the website on your computer. Building the
website produces a set a HTML pages stored on your system that you can
open in your usual web browser even while working offline. Doing so is
useful for writers and designers to see how their
changes will apply on the website.
