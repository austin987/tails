# Known tasks

We have identified some things that we would like to see improved on
our website: see the [website-related
tasks](https://redmine.tails.boum.org/code/projects/tails/issues?query_id=115)

# Other ideas

Nevertheless, if you are a web or graphics person, you can surely
find other ideas to improve the Tails website! Even if you don't plan
to implement every suggested enhancement yourself, it may be worth
[creating
tickets](https://redmine.tails.boum.org/code/projects/tails/issues/new) with
your ideas so that others can benefit from your insight.
