- **bulleted lists**

  Refer to this article from NN/g on [presenting bulleted
  lists](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/presenting-bulleted-lists/).

- **Debian and Ubuntu version**

  Refer to Debian versions primarily by their number, and additionally
  by their codename.

  * *For example*:
    - Tails 3.0 is based on Debian 9 (Stretch)
    - *Tails Installer* is available on Ubuntu 15.10 (Wily Werewolf) or later.

- **digit grouping**

  Use a thin space (HTML entity: `&thinsp;`) or a space to separate
  groups of three digits.

  * *For example*:
    - $50&thinsp;000

  See [[!wikipedia Decimal_separator#Digit_grouping]] and [[!wikipedia
  ISO_31-0#Numbers]].

- **<i>Files</i>**, **<i>Disks</i>**, etc.

  To refer to GNOME applications:

  - Use their short name as it appears in the menus when giving
    instructions to be executed inside Tails.

    *For example*:
    - Open */live/persistence/TailsData_unlocked/dotfiles* in *Files*.

  - Prepend "*GNOME*" when giving instructions to be executed outside of
    Tails.

    *For example*:
    - Install GNOME Disks in Debian.

- **graphics card**

  And not *graphics adapters*, *graphics*, *graphical hardware*, or
  *video card*.

- **network interface**, **Wi-Fi interface**

  And not *card*, *device*, or *adapter*.

  Still, **USB Wi-Fi adapters** are USB dongles that provide a Wi-Fi interface.

- **persistence feature**

  To refer to the features available in the configuration of the
  *persistent volume*.

  - *For example*: when the <span class="guilabel">Additional
    Software</span> persistence feature is activated.

  The word *persistence* can be omitted if it is redundant from the context
  (for example on [[doc/first_steps/persistence/configure]]).

- **startup options**

  To refer to the kernel command line options that can be specified from
  the *Boot Loader Menu*.

  * *For example:* Adding `radeon.dpm=0` to the [[startup
    options|/doc/first_steps/startup_options#boot_menu]].

- **<span class="application">Tails Greeter</span>**

  Without an article. Not *the Greeter*. Note the formatting as an application.
