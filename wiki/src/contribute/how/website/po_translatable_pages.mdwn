[[!meta title="Checklist for updating po_translatable_pages"]]

ikiwiki.setup contains a list of translatable page paths, separated by "or".
This is useful for two cases:

- Adding .html pages for which we want to generate a PO file
  explicitly,

- Listing pages which should *never* be translated. In the list, these
  pages should be preceded by "!".

Make sure that you:

- Update `po_translatable_pages` in both *ikiwiki.setup* _and_
  *ikiwiki-cgi.setup*.

- Make sure that PO files for the pages that are changed in
  `po_translatable_pages` are either removed or added accordingly.

- Adjust the inline directives that might reference the pages that are
  changed in `po_translatable_pages`. To identify them, execute:
  - `git grep '!inline.*currentlang' -- '*.*m*'`

- Update PO files by
  [[building the website again|contribute/build/website]]
  (you might need to pass `--rebuild`) and unfuzz machine-readable strings.

- To update the configuration of our production website, send a patch
  against
  <https://git-tails.immerda.ch/puppet-tails/tree/templates/website/ikiwiki.setup.erb>
  to <tails-sysadmins@boum.org>.
