[[!meta title="Provide needed input to developers"]]

Some Tails planned features require initial tests, thought and/or
discussion before actual implementation work can start. You may want
to contribute to this effort.

*Do not panic!* Some of this preparation work can be done by people
who lack the technical skills needed to actually implement the desired
feature.

Tasks that are currently stalled by the need for input have the
the `Research`, `Discuss`, or `Test` *Type of work* on our
[[!tails_redmine "" desc="TODO"]] list.
You probably want to start looking at the ones that are also in the
[[!tails_redmine_easy]] first so that you can gain confidence...
and we can smoothly learn to work together.

You may also want to [[test experimental ISO images|contribute/how/testing]].
