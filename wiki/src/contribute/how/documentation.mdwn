# Reporting errors

We do value documentation very much, but it's difficult to keep it
up-to-date. If you find a typo or an error in the documentation please
do let us know — ideally, by submitting a patch with your fix.

# Writing

The easiest documentation tasks may be found by looking at
documentation section on the [[!tails_todo "" desc="TODO"]] list (items tagged `todo/documentation`). Small fixes and
enhancements are greatly welcome, and can be done by [[sending
us|contribute/talk]] Git patches, or by publishing a [[Git]] branch.

Documentation writers coordinate themselves using our usual
[[development communication channels|contribute/talk]].

Documentation writers should also read our [[documentation
guidelines|guidelines]].

You may want to check your contributions before to publish them. 
For that, you can [[build and update the documentation offline|contribute/build/website]].

# Translating

We want Tails [[end-user documentation|doc]] to be translated in
as many languages as possible. See the [[guidelines for
translators|contribute/how/translate]] for details.
