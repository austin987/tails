# Things to translate

If you are a native speaker of one of the languages available on this website,
you can work on correcting, improving or completing the translations that are
already available in Tails.

## Custom programs

Tails comes with several [[custom programs|custom_programs]] which need
translation.

You can find the PO files for each program via gitweb:

  - [[!tails_devel_gitweb_dir config/chroot_local-includes/usr/share/locale]]
  - [Tails Greeter](http://git.immerda.ch/?p=tails/tails-greeter.git;a=tree;f=po;hb=HEAD)
  - [Tails Persistence Setup](http://git.immerda.ch/?p=tails/persistence-setup.git;a=tree;f=po;hb=HEAD)
  - [Tails USB Installer](http://git.immerda.ch/?p=tails/liveusb-creator.git;a=tree;f=po;hb=HEAD)
  - [Whisperback](http://git.immerda.ch/?p=whisperback.git;a=tree;f=po;hb=HEAD)

## Website and documentation

The [[end-user documentation|doc]] is a constant work-in-progress. You can
have a look at the [[todo/documentation_translation]] page to know which pages
are ready to be translated.

## Other text to be translated

See the *Translate* section of the [[/TODO]] list.

# For English native speakers

Most of Tails' developers are not native English speakers so you're also more than
welcome to edit, rephrase, correct or improve our English. Since you won't be
able to use translation tools for that but rather edit the original code or wiki
pages your best option will be using Git to submit patches.

# Translation tools

## Web interface

One can translate pages on this website using the web interface: there
is an *Improve translation* button on the top right of every page that
is a translation. It is nice for quick tasks such as un-fuzzying
a recently changed string or fixing a typo; on the other hand, most
translators find it painful and error-prone for more serious
translation work.

Moreover, parts of Tails (most notably our custom programs) cannot be
translated using the web interface. We therefore recommend anyone
willing to seriously get involved into Tails translation work to use
more appropriate tools, such as a real PO file editor; see below for
details.

## Locked pages

Some pages on this website are 'locked' and cannot be edited through the web
interface. Those are pages we considered too sensitive for open editing: the
Download page, the page about our GnuPG key, etc. For those pages you will need
to use Git to send us your work.

## PO editor

The [Poedit] editor is installed in Tails.

Many different workflows can be used to translate Tails strings
using a PO editor. Let's describe a few recommended ones, from the
smallest to the biggest initial setup time... the last ones actually
being the most comfortable to work with in the long run.

### Piggy-back the web interface

1. In the web interface, click the *Improve translation* button on the
   page you wish to translate.
2. In the text edition web page, copy the whole text.
3. Paste it into a new, empty raw text document.
4. Save this text document as a file whose name ends with the `.po`
   extension.
5. Open the `.po` file in your preferred PO file editor.
6. Translate whatever you can.
7. Paste back the whole resulting text into your web browser.
8. Preview your changes.
9. Click *Save* when satisfied with the results.

### Using Git

You can either send us Git patches or ask us to pull from your Git
branch.

Note that the website shall be translated in the `master` branch,
while custom Tails programs live in the `devel` branch.

#### Send us Git patches

1. Clone Tails [[Git repository|contribute/git]] onto your local system.
2. Translate whatever you can in your preferred PO file editor. 
3. Commit the changes you made to `.po` files.
   You could encounter numerous false positive when committing modified `.po`
   files. It's due to the fact that Poedit [doesn't handle the wordwrapping 
   correctly](http://www.poedit.net/trac/ticket/25). In order to avoid this, 
   you should run the following command :
     `msgcat --width=80 -o your_output_file.po your_input_file.po`
4. Use the `git format-patch` command to prepare patches.
5. [[Send us|contribute/talk]] your patches.
6. Frequently merge changes from our main repository into yours.

#### Ask us to pull from your Git branch

1. Setup your personal [[Git repository|contribute/git]]: if you already know
   where to host it in a public place, this is great; or else [fork us
   on repo.or.cz](http://repo.or.cz/w/tails.git).
2. Translate whatever you can in your preferred PO file editor. 
3. Commit the changes you made to `.po` files.
   You could encounter numerous false positive when committing modified `.po`
   files. It's due to the fact that Poedit [doesn't handle the wordwrapping 
   correctly](http://www.poedit.net/trac/ticket/25). In order to avoid this, 
   you should run the following command :
     `msgcat --width=80 -o your_output_file.po your_input_file.po`
4. Push your changes to your online Git repository.
5. [[Ask us|contribute/talk]] to pull from the branch you worked on.
6. Frequently merge changes from our main repository into yours.

# The tails-l10n mailing list

Regular translators and translating teams coordinate themselves on the
tails-l10n mailing list. Please <a
href='https://mailman.boum.org/listinfo/tails-l10n/'>subscribe</a> to
the list if you want to become a regular translator.

Any message sent to this list is stored in a public archive, so beware
of what your email content and headers reveal about yourself: location,
IP address, etc.

# Add support for a new language

For Tails to be available in a new language, both the website and the custom
programs need to be translated. Please keep in mind that this represent quite a
lot of work. Having just a few pages of the website translated in a new
language is not really helpful for new people who don't understand English to
really use Tails.

Here are a few things that would be required in order to start
translating Tails to a new language:

1. It is really required to be a team of translators and not a single person.
That also allow for peer reviews between the team, more flexibility when
important deadlines arrives, etc.

2. At least part of the team should subscribe to the [[tails-l10n mailing
list|translate#tails-l10n]]

3. Dealing intensively with translations requires learning to use PO files,
maybe using [POEdit], and possibly a bit of git. Translating from the website
interface should be thought as a secondary option in order to do small fixes or
get the contribution of extra translators but not as a primary tool to work
with. But working with PO files is not that hard. See the [[translation
tools|translate#tools]] section.

4. Since the content of the website is sensitive in terms of privacy
protection. The Tails developers need to establish contacts with trusted people
to review the work.

5. Keep in mind that useful translations need to be maintained on the long run.
This maybe takes a few hours a month.

Once those conditions are fulfilled, the new team can start working on a first
batch of translations.
