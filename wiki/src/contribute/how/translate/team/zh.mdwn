# How to join the Chinese translation team?

New contributors should first subscribe to the [[mailing list for
translators|https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-l10n/]] and
introduce themselves to the Chinese team on the list.

We currently work in both Simplified and Traditional Chinese and use
`opencc` to convert our work between the two writing systems.

# How to translate into Chinese

An introduction on how to translate can be found on jxtai's blog,
written in traditional Chinese
[https://blog.jxtsai.info/2017/08/04/about-tails-l10n/](https://blog.jxtsai.info/2017/08/04/about-tails-l10n/).

# What can be translated

* **This website** must be translated in the `master` branch of the
  [main Tails Git repository](https://git-tails.immerda.ch/tails/).
  Please read the documentation about [[translating with
  Git|translate/with_Git]] first.

* Website [core pages to
  translate](https://github.com/twngo/Tails-zh_TW/wiki/core_to_translate)

* The Chinese team does not use Git to **translate Tails custom programs**.
  Instead, and for this part only, we rely on [[Transifex|translate/with_Transifex]].

# Glossaries used by the Chinese translation team

The Chinese team uses [Torproject's
glossary](https://www.transifex.com/otf/torproject/glossary/zh_CN/)

# Contributors' repositories

* jxtsai: [[https://github.com/twngo/tails/]] (traditional Chinese)
* psychi: [[https://github.com/mdrights/tails-zh_CN]] (simplified
  Chinese)
