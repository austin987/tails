# What can be translated

* **This website** must be translated in the `master` branch of the
  [main Tails Git repository](https://git-tails.immerda.ch/tails/).
  Please read the documentation about [[translating with
  Git|translate/with_Git]] first.

# Workflow

We have three main communication channels:

* Our [[wiki|blueprint/l10n_Italian]], to share guides and tools and to keep trace of who is doing what;
* Online assemblies, to discuss about how translations and reviews are going;
* A [mailing list](https://www.autistici.org/mailman/listinfo/transitails) (<transitails@inventati.org>), to plan assemblies and for other day by day communications.

We discuss together which files should have the priority, then each translator makes a branch with a group of files s/he wants to translate. When the translations are ready, they are reviewed by another member of the team and then merged. 

We use [Poedit](https://poedit.net/) for the translations.

If you want to contribute, please contact us first through the mailing list. We kindly ask not to start translating files on your own before contacting the team, as we prefer to discuss things together and have a consensus before starting to work.
