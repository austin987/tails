Upstream and packaging
======================

For this package, "upstream" means, from a Debian packaging
point-of-view, the state of our master branch. Let's not pretend we
have not forked liveusb-creator, and admit we are now upstream for our
own version.

Still, most of the time, we will be releasing -N "Debian"-specific
packages, that really are packaged Git snapshots, rather than new
"upstream" releases. Only when we really need it, we will update the
"orig" tarball from our master branch.

Tidy up upstream source
=======================

Merge new Fedora's changes if needed:

    git checkout master
    git remote add fedora git://git.fedorahosted.org/git/liveusb-creator
    git fetch fedora
    git remote add lmacken https://github.com/lmacken/liveusb-creator.git
    git fetch lmacken

Then see if they have tagged a release that we haven't merged yet,
and merge the release tag if needed (in advance before the freeze,
and following our usual review'n'merge process).

Do extra changes if needed.

Generate a new upstream tarball
===============================

**If needed** (that is, basically if dpkg-source complains, when
running git-buildpackage below, that it cannot represent changes in
binary files), generate a new upstream tarball from the tip of our
master branch.

The new upstream version should be something like `3.11.6+tails1`:
only increment the number after `+tails` if the new release is still
based on Fedora's 3.11.6. Else, set the part before `+tails` to the
new Fedora release's version number, and reset the right side to
`+tails1`.

    export NEW_UPSTREAM_VERSION=XXX
    git archive --prefix=git/ \
       --output=../tarballs/liveusb-creator_$NEW_UPSTREAM_VERSION.orig.tar.xz \
       master

Update the Debian package
=========================

Checkout the branch with Debian package specifics:

    git checkout debian

Merge upstream changes:

    git merge master

Update `debian/changelog`:

    git-dch && dch -e

(Do not forget to set the appropriate release.)

Commit:

    git commit debian/changelog -m "$(head -n 1 debian/changelog | sed -e 's,).*,),')"

Build a new Debian package (use a Wheezy/i386 chroot):

    git-buildpackage

If `git-buildpackage` complains about a missing `upstream/$VERSION`,
then manually download the corresponding tarball (which can be found
in our Debian repo unless upstream just had a new release) and place
it in `..`, and then re-run the command with `--git-no-pristine-tar`.

Add a signed tag to the Git repository and push the changes:

    git-buildpackage --git-tag-only --git-sign-tags && \
       git push && git push --tags

(Make sure both `master` and `debian` are pushed.)

Add the Debian package to Tails
===============================

Sign the package:

    debsign $CHANGES_FILE

Upload:

    dupload --to tails $CHANGES_FILE
