[[!meta title="Releasing Thunderbird"]]

Until we have
[[!tails_ticket 6156 desc="upstreamed our secure autoconfiguration patches"]]
we have to maintain Thunderbird ourselves. This means we need to
[track](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/thunderbird) new versions hitting
Debian Stable.

The first time you do this requires some additional steps (WARNING!
this will download almost 2 GiB of data):

1. Clone [Tails' Thunderbird repo](http://git.tails.boum.org/thunderbird/).

1. Add a remote for Debian:

        git remote add debian-upstream git://anonscm.debian.org/pkg-mozilla/thunderbird.git

Let's pretend the scenario is that Thunderbird 45.3.0-1 has just been
released:

    VERSION=45.8.0-3
    TAG=debian/1%${VERSION}

1. `git fetch && git fetch debian-upstream`

1. Verify the tag (expected to have been made with the key
   8B94 819C 2555 70A3 74B6 2CCD 26E3 C875 A744 20EF):

        git tag -v "${TAG}"

1. Let's update our branch to the new version:

        git checkout tails/stretch && git merge origin/tails/stretch && \
        git merge --no-edit "${TAG}"

   Now you most likely will have to deal with a merge conflict in
   debian/changelog -- just reorder the entries chronologically. Then
   let's release a new version:

        TAILS_VERSION="1:${VERSION}+tails1" && \
        DISTRIBUTION="feature-thunderbird-${VERSION}" && \
        dch --newversion "${TAILS_VERSION}" --force-bad-version  \
            --distribution "${DISTRIBUTION}" --force-distribution \
            "Rebuild Thunderbird with Tails' secure autoconfiguration patches." && \
        git commit debian/changelog \
            -m "document changes and release ${TAILS_VERSION}" && \
        gbp buildpackage --git-debian-branch=tails/stretch \
            --git-sign-tags --git-tag-only

1. Fetch the Debian sources to be used for the build:

        ICEDOVE_SOURCES="$(mktemp -d)" && \
        GIT_DIR="$(pwd)" && \
        cd "${ICEDOVE_SOURCES}" && \
        apt source thunderbird="1:${VERSION}" && \
        cp thunderbird_*.orig*.tar.xz "${GIT_DIR}/.." && \
        cd "${GIT_DIR}" && \
        rm -r "${ICEDOVE_SOURCES}"

   Note: we cannot use the `pristine-tar` branch since Jessie builds
   expect split .orig sources for l10n stuff, which is not the case in
   Sid, which `pristine-tar` is made for. Or something like
   this. Let's not waste time on investigating this.

1. Build packages:

        gbp buildpackage --git-debian-branch=tails/jessie

1. Include all sources in the `.changes` file:

        CHANGES_FILE="../thunderbird_${VERSION}+tails1_amd64.changes" && \
        changestool "${CHANGES_FILE}" includeallsources

1. Due to [[!tails_ticket 11531]] we won't be able to push the tag
   generated by `gbp` so we have to replace it with a differently
   named tag:

        NEW_TAG="$(echo ${TAG} | sed 's/1%//')" && \
        git tag -s "${NEW_TAG}" -m "thunderbird Debian release 1:${VERSION}" "${TAG}" && \
        TAG="${NEW_TAG}"

1. Git push and upload packages:

        git push origin "${TAG}" tails/stretch && \
        debsign "${CHANGES_FILE}" && \
        dupload --to tails "${CHANGES_FILE}"

   At the moment pushing `TAG` may fail due to
   [[!tails_ticket 11531]]. We'll just have to save these tags locally
   until when it's solved, and then push...
