[[!meta title="Updating Thunderbird patches"]]

Until we have
[[!tails_ticket 6156 desc="upstreamed our secure autoconfiguration patches"]]
we have to maintain a patch series for Thunderbird ourselves, that we apply
while building Tails images.

We need to follow the following instructions whenever the patch series
we have exported to tails.git does not apply anymore, therefore breaking
the Tails images build process.

1. Create, checkout and push a branch in `tails.git` with the
   `+force-all-tests` suffix (most of `features/thunderbird.feature`
   is tagged `@fragile`).

1. The first time you do this requires some additional steps (WARNING!
   this will download almost 2 GiB of data):

   1. Clone [Tails' Thunderbird repo](http://git.tails.boum.org/thunderbird/).

   1. Add a remote for Debian:

        git remote add debian-upstream https://salsa.debian.org/mozilla-team/thunderbird.git

1. Set environment variables:

   Let's pretend the scenario is that Thunderbird 60.0-3 has just been
   released:

        VERSION="60.0-3"
        TAG="debian/1%$(echo ${VERSION:?} | tr '~' '_')"

1. `git fetch && git fetch debian-upstream`

1. Verify the signed tag:

        git tag -v "${TAG:?}"

   The tag should have been signed with one of the keys that follow;
   investigate if it's not the case:

    - `8B94 819C 2555 70A3 74B6  2CCD 26E3 C875 A744 20EF`
    - `B70D FC6F 134F ECFC 011E  62AA 8301 6014 251D 1DB0`
    - `D343 9DAA 19DC FACD AE87  9CF2 B999 CDB5 8C8D DBD2`

1. Let's update our branch to the new version:

        git checkout tails/stretch && git merge origin/tails/stretch && \
        git merge --no-edit "${TAG:?}"

1. Let's ensure our patches still apply cleanly:

   1. Check if they do:

          quilt push -a

   2. Regardless of whether our patches applied cleanly, clean up:

          quilt pop -a && rm -rf .pc

   3. If our patches applied cleanly, move on. Otherwise:

      XXX (undocumented as we prefer focusing our efforts on
      upstreaming our patches than on documenting the current,
      temporary state of things): after reverse-engineering the state
      of our Git repository, it seems that one should create a new
      `secure_account_creation-${VERSION:?}` branch forked of the
      latest existing one, transplant our commits on top of `${TAG}`
      with the appropriate `--onto` option, squash our commits into
      a new `secure_account_creation-${VERSION:?}-squashed` branch,
      extract updated patches from there into
      `debian/patches/secure-account-creation/`.

1. Git push:

        git push --follow-tags origin \
           tails/stretch \
           upstream-60.x \
           pristine-tar

   Note: pushing some tags will fail due to [[!tails_ticket 11531]].

1. Set variables according to your local environment:

        TAILS_GIT_CHECKOUT=/path/to/your/tails/git/checkout
        THUNDERBIRD_GIT_CHECKOUT=/path/to/your/thunderbird/git/checkout

1. Update the patches in tails.git:

        THUNDERBIRD_GIT_COMMIT=$(git --git-dir="$THUNDERBIRD_GIT_CHECKOUT" rev-parse --verify HEAD)
        TAILS_GIT_PATCHES_DIR="config/chroot_local-includes/usr/share/tails/build/thunderbird-patches"
		cd "$TAILS_GIT_CHECKOUT" && \
        git rm -r "$TAILS_GIT_PATCHES_DIR" && \
		cp -r "${THUNDERBIRD_GIT_CHECKOUT}/debian/patches/secure-account-creation \
		   "$TAILS_GIT_PATCHES_DIR" && \
		grep -E '^secure-account-creation/' "${THUNDERBIRD_GIT_CHECKOUT}/debian/patches/series" \
           | perl -pE 's{^secure-account-creation/}{}' \
           > "${TAILS_GIT_PATCHES_DIR}/series" && \
        git add "$TAILS_GIT_PATCHES_DIR" && \
		git commit -m "Update Thunderbird patches from icedove.git at commit ${THUNDERBIRD_GIT_COMMIT}"

1. Ensure the Thunderbird account setup wizard works in an image built
   from your tails.git branch.
