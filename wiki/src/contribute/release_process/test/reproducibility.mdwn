[[!meta title="Verification of Tails reproducibility"]]

<div class="note">

After accepting to be the <i>Trusted Reproducer</i> you should have been
instructed to go here immediately and read the "Preparation"
section. For a planned release you should be doing this weeks before
the release you are about to reproduce; for emergency releases you
likely only have days or even hours. If you were not, file a
ticket about this, since an important part of process must have been
missed by the RM.

# Preparation (when accepting to be the Trusted Reproducer)

Use whatever scheduling tool you prefer to make sure you will, on your
own initiative, return to this document and follow it within 72 hours
from the start of the manual testing session. In particular, do not
trust anything said by the RM about this process: we assume their
system may be compromised and could be used by an adversary to
mislead you.

# Gather input data

## Inputs from the release process

Look at the "Environment" section at the beginning of [[the release
process instructions|contribute/release_process]] and set the
following variables as instructed:

* `ARTIFACTS`
* `DIST`
* `ISOS`
* `RELEASE_BRANCH`
* `VERSION`

<!-- Now for the only tricky part, setting `IUK_SOURCE_VERSIONS`. It should -->
<!-- simply list the old Tails versions that will get an automatic upgrade -->
<!-- to the current release, and should be set correctly by this command -->
<!-- most of the time: -->

<!--     IUK_SOURCE_VERSIONS="$( -->
<!--         curl "http://dl.amnesia.boum.org/tails/${DIST:?}/iuk/" \ -->
<!--         | grep --extended-regexp --only-matching \ -->
<!--                "Tails_amd64_[^_]+_to_${VERSION:?}.iuk" \ -->
<!--         | sort -u \ -->
<!--         | tr '_' ' ' \ -->
<!--         | cut -d' ' -f3 -->
<!--     )" -->
<!--     echo -e "Got these IUK source versions:\n${IUK_SOURCE_VERSIONS}" -->

<!-- Now sanity check the contents of `IUK_SOURCE_VERSIONS`: -->

<!-- * If empty, the RM has probably not uploaded them yet so you may have -->
<!--   to wait. -->
<!-- * Make sure each listed version actually has been released! :) -->
<!-- * [[Figure out the rules for how to set this -->
<!--   variable|contribute/release_process#prepare-iuk]] and double-check -->
<!--   that it makes sense! Note that exceptions happen (e.g. there could -->
<!--   be a bug in some old versions upgrader so we skip it). -->
<!-- * If the release notes have already been written (generally there is a -->
<!--   ticket about it) it should list which versions have automatic upgrades. -->

## Inputs from manual testers

A manual tester should have sent you
clear-signed hashes for all products of this release. Then:

1. Verify that the
   signature is valid and made by one of our usual manual testers
2. Put the hashes, excluding the OpenPGP signature data, into a file
   called `SHA512SUMS.txt`.

## Your inputs

Set these environment variables accordingly:

<!-- * `ISOS_CHECKOUT`: path to your Tails ISO history repo checkout. -->
<!-- * `PACKAGES_FILE="${ISOS:?}/tails-amd64-${VERSION:?}/tails-amd64-${VERSION:?}.iso.packages"` -->
* `PUBLISHED_ARTIFACTS`: some _new_ directory where you can download
  gigabytes of data to.
* `SHA512SUMS`: the path of the `SHA512SUMS.txt` file from above.
* `TAILS_CHECKOUT`: path to your Tails Git repo checkout.


## Derived environment variables

    cd "${TAILS_CHECKOUT:?}" && \
    TAG="$(echo $VERSION | tr '~' '-')" && \
    TAG_COMMIT="$(git rev-parse --verify ${TAG:?})" && \
    git fetch && \
    git checkout "${RELEASE_BRANCH:?}" && \
    git merge "origin/${RELEASE_BRANCH:?}"

# Build your own products

## Build your own images

1. Fetch and verify the Git tag:

        cd "${TAILS_CHECKOUT:?}" && \
        git fetch origin --tags --force && \
        git tag -v "${TAG}"

   If the last output is a "Good signature" for the expected tag, made by
   Tails signing key, then we are good.
   Otherwise, if you see _anything_ else, we're _not_ good; immediately
   contact the RM and <tails@boum.org>! Proceeding with the rest of the steps
   are pointless in this case, so await instruction.

2. Build ISO and USB images:

        cd "${TAILS_CHECKOUT:?}" && \
        git checkout "${TAG:?}" && \
        git submodule update --init && \
        export SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH=$(date --utc --date="$(dpkg-parsechangelog --show-field=Date)" '+%s') && \
        rake build && \
        mkdir "${ISOS:?}/tails-amd64-${VERSION:?}" && \
        mv "${ARTIFACTS:?}/tails-amd64-${VERSION:?}".* \
           "${ISOS:?}/tails-amd64-${VERSION:?}/"

<!-- ## Build your own IUKs -->

<!-- 1. Obtain needed old Tails releases: -->

<!--         cd "${ISOS_CHECKOUT:?}" && \ -->
<!--         git annex sync && \ -->
<!--         for old_version in ${IUK_SOURCE_VERSIONS:?}; do -->
<!--             tails_dir="tails-amd64-${old_version}" && \ -->
<!--             git annex get "${tails_dir}" && \ -->
<!--             cp --dereference --recursive "${tails_dir}" "${ISOS:?}" -->
<!--         done -->

<!-- 2. Set your `iuk` Git checkout to the desired state: -->

<!--            IUK_VERSION="$(awk '/^tails-iuk\s/ { print $2 }' "${PACKAGES_FILE:?}")" && \ -->
<!--            if [ -z "${IUK_VERSION}" ]; then -->
<!--                echo 'Failed to determine IUK_VERSION, aborting' && \ -->
<!--                false -->
<!--            fi -->

<!-- 3. Follow the [[Build the Incremental Upgrade -->
<!--    Kits|contribute/release_process#prepare-iuk]] instructions. Note that -->
<!--    the value of `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` set above is needed! -->

# Verification

If there is *any* type of mismatch at some point below, let the RM and
<tails@boum.org> know *immediately*! But still proceed and do everything below,
potentially reporting multiple different issues.

## Verify that your products match what was tested

    cd "${ISOS:?}/tails-amd64-${VERSION:?}" && \
    sha512sum -c "${SHA512SUMS:?}"

## Wait for the release to be published

In order to get the guarantees we're looking for here,
the following steps have to be done only after the release has been made public.

## Download published products

    mkdir -p "${PUBLISHED_ARTIFACTS:?}" && \
    cd "${PUBLISHED_ARTIFACTS:?}" && \
    mkdir tails-amd64-${VERSION:?} && \
    cd tails-amd64-${VERSION:?} && \
    wget http://dl.amnesia.boum.org/tails/${DIST:?}/tails-amd64-${VERSION:?}/tails-amd64-${VERSION:?}.{img,iso}

## Verify that your products match what was published

### ISO and USB images

    for type in iso usb ; do
       case "$type" in
          iso)
             ext=iso
             ;;
          usb)
             ext=img
             ;;
       esac
       if cmp --quiet \
          "${ISOS:?}/tails-amd64-${VERSION:?}/tails-amd64-${VERSION:?}.$ext" \
          "${PUBLISHED_ARTIFACTS:?}/tails-amd64-${VERSION:?}/tails-amd64-${VERSION:?}.$ext" ; then
          echo "OK: locally built $type matches the published one"
       else
          echo "FAIL: locally built $type does not match the published one"
       fi
    done

### IDF

If you are verifying the reproducibility of anything but a stable release
(for example, a beta or a RC), skip this part.

Download the IDF by running:

    wget https://tails.boum.org/install/v2/Tails/amd64/${DIST:?}/latest.json

Then check that the hashes and sizes match what you have built:

    sudo apt install jq && \
    for type in iso usb ; do
       locally_built_dir="${ISOS:?}/tails-amd64-${VERSION:?}"
       case "$type" in
          iso)
             ext=iso
             ;;
          usb)
             ext=img
             ;;
       esac
       locally_built_file="${locally_built_dir}/tails-amd64-${VERSION:?}.$ext"
       idf_size=$(cat latest.json | jq ".installations[0].\"installation-paths\" | map(select(.type == \"$ext\"))[0].\"target-files\"[0].size")
       locally_built_size=$(stat --format='%s' "$locally_built_file")
       if [ "$idf_size" = "$locally_built_size" ]; then
          echo "OK: $type size matches"
       else
          echo "FAIL: $type size does not match"
       fi
       idf_sha256=$(cat latest.json | jq --raw-output ".installations[0].\"installation-paths\" | map(select(.type == \"$ext\"))[0].\"target-files\"[0].sha256")
       locally_built_sha256=$(sha256sum "$locally_built_file" | cut -f 1 -d ' ' | tr -d '\n')
       if [ "$idf_sha256" = "$locally_built_sha256" ]; then
          echo "OK: $type sha256 matches"
       else
          echo "FAIL: $type sha256 does not match"
       fi
    done

<!-- ### UDFs -->

<!-- Examine each UDF by running: -->

<!--     for old_version in ${IUK_SOURCE_VERSIONS}; do -->
<!--         url=https://tails.boum.org/upgrade/v2/Tails/${old_version}/amd64/${DIST:?}/upgrades.yml -->
<!--         ( -->
<!--             echo "Looking at '${url}':" -->
<!--             echo -->
<!--             curl --silent --show-error ${url} -->
<!--         ) | less -->
<!--     done -->

<!-- and checking that there are either two `target-files` entries: -->

<!-- * one of `type: full`, i.e. a full upgrade (so it refers to the ISO image) -->
<!--   and must have the same values as for the IDF (you were asked to save -->
<!--   the output above), so verify that it matches! -->

<!-- * one of `type: incremental`, i.e. an incremental upgrade (so it refers to a -->
<!--   IUK) and should match the output of: -->

<!--       for old_version in ${IUK_SOURCE_VERSIONS}; do -->
<!--       cat <<EOF -->
<!--       Expected values for https://tails.boum.org/upgrade/v2/Tails/${old_version}/amd64/${DIST:?}/upgrades.yml: -->
      
<!--       sha256: $(sha256sum "${ISOS:?}/Tails_amd64_${old_version}_to_${VERSION:?}.iuk" | cut -f 1 -d ' ' | tr -d '\n') -->
<!--       size: $(du --bytes "${ISOS:?}/Tails_amd64_${old_version}_to_${VERSION:?}.iuk" | cut -f1) -->
<!--       url: http://dl.amnesia.boum.org/tails/${DIST:?}/iuk/Tails_amd64_${old_version}_to_${VERSION:?}.iuk -->
      
<!--       EOF -->
<!--       done -->
