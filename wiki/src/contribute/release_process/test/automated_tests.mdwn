# Introduction

The automated test suite is essentially a glue between:

* [Sikuli](http://www.sikuli.org/), used for simulating user
  interaction,
* [libvirt](http://libvirt.org/), used for running a specific build of
  Tails in a virtual machine, and
* [cucumber](http://cukes.info/), for defining features and scenarios
  testing them using the above two components.

Its goal is to automate the development and release testing processes
with a Continuous Integration server.

A [[!tails_gitweb features/support/helpers/sikuli_helper.rb
desc="custom thin Ruby wrapper"]], using the
[rjb](http://rjb.rubyforge.org/) Ruby-Java bridge, gives us access to
the Sikuli programmatic interface from our step definitions.

## Setup and usage

See [[contribute/release_process/test/setup]] and [[contribute/release_process/test/usage]].

## Features

With this tool, it is possible to:

  * Create, modify and destroy virtual machines that can run Tails from
    a variety of media (primarily DVD and USB drives).
  * Create different kinds of virtual storage (IDE, USB, DVD...),
    and either cold or hot plug/unplug them into/from the
    virtual machine.
  * Modify the virtual machine's hardware, e.g. its amount of RAM,
    its processor features (PAE), etc.
  * Simulate user interaction with the system under testing and check
    its state.
  * Run arbitrary shell commands inside the virtual machine.
  * Take screenshots from the display of the virtual machine, at
    particular events, like when a scenario fails. Complete test
    sessions can also be captured into a video.
  * Capture and analyze the network traffic of the system under testing.

## source vs. product cucumber features

Fundamentally speaking there are two types of tests:

* Tests that make sure that the Tails *sources* behave correctly *at
  build time* (example: `features/build.feature`); these ones are
  aptly tagged `@source`; and,
* Tests that make sure that the product built from Tails sources, i.e.
  a Tails ISO image, behaves correctly *at run time*; these ones are
  tagged `@product`.

The requirement of these are quite different; for instance, a
`@product` test must have access to a Tails ISO image to test, whereas a
`@source` test doesn't. Therefore their environments are setup
separately using our custom `BeforeFeature` hook, with the respective
tag.

# Implementation

## Running cucumber in the right environment

The `run_test_suite` script is a wrapper on top of `cucumber`, that
sets the correct environment up:

* It uses `Xvfb` so that the `DISPLAY` environment variable points to
  an unused X display (tip: use `Xvfb`) with screen size and color
  depth matching what the Sikuli images are optimized for (that is,
  1024x768 / 24-bit).
* It sets the `SIKULI_HOME` environment variable to the directory
  where sikuli script is installed for Java (`/usr/share/java` in
  Debian).
* It runs `unclutter` on `$DISPLAY` to prevent the mouse
  pointer from masking GUI elements looked for by Sikuli.
* It passes `--format ExtraHooks::Pretty` to `cucumber` calls, to get
  access to our custom `{After,Before}Feature` hooks.

## Remote shell

This started out as a hack, and while it has evolved it largely
remains so. A proper, reliable, established replacement would be
welcome, but seems unlikely given the requirements:

Requirements on the host (the remote shell client):

* can execute a command with blocking until command completion on the
  server, and get back return code, stdout and stderr separately.
* can spawn a command without blocking (except an ACK that the server
  has run the command, perhaps).
* usable by an unprivileged user

Requirements on the guest (the remote shell server):

* has to work without a network connection.
* should interfere minimally with the surrounding system (e.g. no
  firewall exceptions; actually we don't want any network traffic at
  all from it, but this kind of follows from the previous requirement
  any way)

# The art of writing new product test cases

Writing new `@source` features, scenarios or steps should be pretty
straightforward for anyone with experience with `cucumber`, but the
same can't be said about `@product` tests, so below we give some
pointers for the latter.

## Resources

In addition to the Sikuli, libvirt and Cucumber documentation linked
to in the introduction:

 * [ruby-libvirt API](http://libvirt.org/ruby/api/index.html)
 * [sikuli API](http://doc.sikuli.org/toc.html)

## Writing new features and scenarios

First, one should have a good look at especially
`features/step_definitions/common_steps.rb` and the other features to
get a general idea of what already is possible. There is a good chance
there's already implementations for many steps necessary for reaching
the desired state right before when the stuff special to the intended
feature begins.

### Common steps example

In order to learn some basic step dependencies, and concepts and
features of the automated test suite used in features and scenarios,
let's walk through a few typical steps, in order:

    Given a computer

This is how each scenario (or background) should start. This step
destroys any residual VM from a previous scenario, and sets up a
completely fresh one, with all defaults. The defaults are defined in
`features/domains/default.xml`, but some highlights are:

* One virtual `x86_64` CPU with one core
* 1 GiB of RAM
* ACPI, APIC and PAE enabled
* UTC harware clock
* A DVD drive loaded with the Tails from the ISO
* No other storage plugged
* USB 2.0 controller
* Ethernet interface, plugged into a network bridged with the host

After this step there's a number of steps that reconfigures the
above...

    And I create a 10 GiB disk named "some_disk"

The identifier (`some_disk`) is later used if we want to plug it or
otherwise act on it. Note that all media created this way are backed
by [[!wikipedia qcow2]] images, which grow only as they consume
capacity. All such media are destroyed after the feature ends.

This step does not necessarily have to be run this early, but it does
if we want to plug it as a non-removable drive...

    And I plug ide drive "some_disk"

Note that we can decide which type of drive `some_disk` is here. If we
pick a non-removable media, like in this case, it has to be done
before we start the virtual machine. Removable media, such as USB
drives, can be plugged into a live system at any later point.

    And the network is plugged

This plugs the network interface to the host-bridged network (which is
the default). There's also the "unplugged" version, which generally is
preferred for features that don't rely on the network (mostly so we
won't hammer the Tor network unnecessarily). These steps can also be
performed on a already running system under test.

    And I start the computer

This is where we actually boot the virtual machine.

    And the computer boots Tails

This step:

* verifies that we see the boot menu
* adds any boot options added via `I set Tails to boot with options ...`
* makes sure that Tails Greeter starts
* makes sure that the remote shell is up and running

    And I enable more Tails Greeter options

This is required for steps enabling Tails Greeter options, like the
next one, or the `I enable Microsoft Windows XP camouflage` step.
Note that the "I set sudo password ..." step has to be run before the
other Tails Greeter option steps as it relies on keyboard navigation.

    And I set sudo password "asdf"

Beyond the obvious, after this step all steps requiring the
administrative password have access to it.

    And I log in to a new session
    And GNOME has started
    And I have a network connection
    And Tor is ready

All these should be pretty obvious. It could be mentioned that the
last two steps, like many others, depend on the remote shell to
be working.

    And I have closed all annoying notifications

The notifications can block GUI elements that we're looking for later
with Sikuli, so they are to be closed whenever for essentially all
tests of GUI applications. If we have a network connection, so the
time syncing starts and shows its notifications, then this step should be
run after the previous step. Otherwise it always depends on the `GNOME
has started` step.

    And available upgrades have been checked

Since Tor is working, the check for upgrades will be run. We have to
wait for it to complete because that generally will break later if we
use a background snapshot.

    And I save the state so the background can be restored next scenario

This is where the state of the VM is saved into the so called
background snapshot the first time it is reached within a feature. For
all subsequent scenarios, all steps before this one are skipped and
the VM state is restored from the snapshot in this state. This step
also makes sure that the remote shell is back up, and if Tor was
running, that the time is resynced from the host and Tor is restarted
and working again.

It's called the background snapshot because generally we only want to
do this if we define a background in a feature. We don't want to use
the above step if scenarios that have different steps before this one.

### Scenarios involving the Internet

Each such new scenario should sniff network traffic, and check that
all Internet traffic has only flowed through Tor. See the `apt`
feature for a simple example of how to do it.

## Writing new steps

### The tools and some guidelines for their usage

In essense, the tools we have for interacting with the Tails instance
are:

* the VM helper class,
* Sikuli, and
* the remote shell.

It should be fairly obvious when to use the VM helper class (stuff
relating to the virtual hardware), but there is some overlap between
Sikuli and the remote shell.

Sikuli:

* Should be used in all instances where we want to simulate user
  interaction with the Tails system. For instance, when we start an
  application we usually want to click our way through the GNOME
  applications menu to stay true to what an actual user would do.
* It comes in handy when we want to verify some state pertaining
  to the GUI.

The remote shell:

* Useful for testing non-GUI state.
* Useful for reaching some state required before we test stuff
  depending on user interaction (which should use Sikuli!).
* It is acceptable (but not encouraged) to use the remote shell for
  simulating user terminal interaction when we need to analyze the
  commands output. This is because of Sikuli's OCR capabilities are
  poor, and cannot be depended on.

### Background snapshot compatibility

All steps that possibly could be in a feature's background (that can
be quickly skipped through thanks to background snapshots) should in
general contain the following in its absolute beginning:

    next if @skip_steps_while_restoring_background

This is what makes it possible to pass the step without actually
running it.

Note the "in general" above, though. Sometimes there may be code in
a step that we should let run before we skip the test. In general
that's just assignment of input from a step into a global/class
variable that is used in subsequent steps. For an instructive example
of this, see the `I set sudo password ...` step in
`features/step_definitions/common_steps.rb`, which saves the password
into a class variable so it can be used by, among others, the `I enter
the sudo password ...` step.

# Limitations and issues

These things are good to know when developing new features, scenarios
or steps.

## The remote shell

### Different behaviour compared to "real" shell

The remote shells have a few surprises in store:

* `pgrep -f` detects itself, which can have potentially serious
  consequences if not dealt with.
* Minor groups are not set, so e.g. the `groups` command may not do
  what you expect, but `groups $USER` does.

These are the currently known oddities of the remote shell, but there
may be more, so beware, and make sure to verify that any commands sent
through it does what you want them to do.

### Remote shell instability

Although very rare, the remote shell can get into a state where it
stops responding, resulting in the test suite waiting for a response
forever.

## Host-to-guest filesystem shares are incompatibile with snapshots

Filesystem shares cannot (due to QEMU limitations) be added to an
active VM, and cannot (due to QEMU limitations) be active
(i.e. mounted) during a snapshot save. For this reason, don't use
filesystem shares in combination with background snapshots. For more
information, see [[!tails_ticket 5571]].

## Plugging SATA drives

When creating a disk (at least when backed by a `raw` image) via the
storage helper, and then plugging it to a Tails instance as SATA
drive, GNOME will report that the drive is failing when inside Tails,
and indeed several SMART tests fail. For now, plug hard disks as IDE
only (or USB, of course).

## Class variables assigned in skippable steps

This is best explained with an example. Let's say we have this feature:

	Background:
    ...
	Given I assign @x with something we read from the VMs state and we know should be 100
	And I save the state so the background can be restored next scenario

	Scenario: 1
	Then @x == 100

	Scenario: 2
	Then @x == 100

As expected, scenario 1 will succeed, but since class variables lie
`@x` are cleared between scenarios, scenario 2 will fail if it is
skippable (i.e. it has the `next if...` thing at the top), which it
should besince it interacts with the VM. To avoid this, make sure to
put *all* steps dealing with the class variable in the background, or
all of them after the background. Alternatively, use global variables
(e.g. `$x`) instead of class variables, since they are never cleared.

Also, see [[!tails_ticket 5847]].
