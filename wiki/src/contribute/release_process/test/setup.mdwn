[[!meta title="Test suite installation and setup"]]

Until we have a Puppet module to manage this in automated fashion,
here's how to setup an environment to run our automated test suite.

Once you have a working environment, see [[test/usage]].

[[!toc levels=2]]

Install dependencies
====================

First of all, one needs a Debian Jessie system with the `non-free` APT
components enabled.

The following packages are necessary on Debian Jessie:

    echo 'deb http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/ testing main contrib non-free' \
        > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/testing.list && \
    echo -e "Package: *\nPin: release o=Debian,a=stable\nPin-Priority: 990" \
        > /etc/apt/preferences.d/Debian_stable && \
    echo -e "Package: *\nPin: release o=Debian,a=testing\nPin-Priority: 500" \
        > /etc/apt/preferences.d/Debian_testing && \
    apt-get update &&
    apt-get install git i18nspector xvfb virt-viewer libsikuli-script-java \
        libxslt1-dev tcpdump unclutter radvd x11-apps syslinux-utils \
        libcap2-bin devscripts ruby-libvirt ruby-rspec gawk ntp ovmf \
        ruby-json x11vnc xtightvncviewer ffmpeg libavcodec-extra-53 \
        libvpx1 dnsmasq-base openjdk-7-jre qemu-kvm qemu-system-x86 libvirt0 \
        libvirt-dev libvirt-bin seabios ruby-rjb ruby-packetfu cucumber && \
    service libvirtd restart

Other requirements
==================

Synchronized clock
------------------

The system running the test suite needs an accurate clock since we
sync the clock from the host to the Tails guest after a background
snapshot restore to appease Tor. This is why we installed ntp above.

File permissions
----------------

The user that runs QEMU (via libvirt) needs read-access at least to
the content of `features/misc_files/` in the Git checkout.

Special use cases
=================

Access the system under test with VNC
-------------------------------------

If you're running the test suite in a nested environnement, install
xtightvncviewer on the bare metal level-0 host. Then you can use vncviewer's
`-via` option so that it automatically setup a ssh tunnel to your first level
test suite domain for you and display the Tails VM. E.g.
where `$DISPLAY` is the display given to you by `run_test_suite` (often 0):

    vncviewer -viewonly -via user@level0 localhost:$DISPLAY

Running the test suite as a non-root user
-----------------------------------------

<div class="note">
This section may not be in tested and working shape.
</div>

This is entirely possible, but there's some additional configuration
required. Run the following as `root`:

    addgroup tcpdump
    dpkg-statoverride --update --add root tcpdump 754 /usr/sbin/tcpdump
    setcap CAP_NET_RAW+eip /usr/sbin/tcpdump
    adduser $USER tcpdump
    adduser $USER libvirt
    adduser $USER libvirt-qemu

It's important to run `setcap` after `dpkg-statoverride` since the
latter deletes all capabilities. Unfortunately the `setcap` command
has to be rerun for that reason everytime the `tcpdump` package is
updated until [[!debbug 662845]] is fixed.

Running these commands will add some interesting capabilities to
`$USER`, so you may want to do this for a dedicated user separate from
your normal user. In that case (and if you run the tests as root) the
`--view` option won't work unless you grant `$USER` access to your
display via `xhost +SI:localhost:$USER`. Alternatively you can use the
`--vnc-server-only` option and manually connect to the VNC server with
your normal user. Just make sure the VNC viewer is in view-only mode
(e.g. `xtightvncviewer --view-only ...`) in order to not interfere
with the testing session.
