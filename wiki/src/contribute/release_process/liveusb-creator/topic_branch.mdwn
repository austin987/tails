[[!meta title="Packaging liveusb-creator topic branches"]]

Let's say your branch is `feature/$TOPIC`, then you package it as
follows:

1. `git checkout -b debian_$TOPIC debian`
2. `git merge feature/$TOPIC`
3. Use `git-dch --auto --snapshot --ignore-branch` too fill `debian/changelog`, and
   insert something like "+feature.$TOPIC.1bugfix-6092-drop-racy-code" (with all special
   characters changed to full stops, i.e. ".") between the version
   last packaged in the "debian" branch, and the gbp snapshot number
   (that looks like "~1.gbpNNNNNN"). In the end, if `$TOPIC =
   7000-blah-bleh` it should look something like:
   3.11.6+tails1-4+feature.7000.blah.bleh~1.gbp4a0c9c
4. Commit the changelog:
   
       git commit debian/changelog
   
5. Build with `git-buildpackage --git-ignore-branch`.
