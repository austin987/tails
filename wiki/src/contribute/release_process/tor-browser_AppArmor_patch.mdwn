[[!meta title="Upstream our changes to Tor Browser's AppArmor policy"]]

# Preparation (first time)

If you don't have our `torbrowser-launcher` Git repo, clone it:

    git clone tails@git.tails.boum.org:torbrowser-launcher

and add a remote for Debian, which is our immediate upstream:

    git remote add debian https://anonscm.debian.org/git/pkg-privacy/packages/torbrowser-launcher.git

and add a remote for the final upstream:

    git remote add upstream-repo https://github.com/micahflee/torbrowser-launcher

# Make our repo up-to-date

Fetch:

    git checkout master && \
    git pull && \
    git fetch debian && \
    git fetch upstream-repo

Finally, make our repo up-to-date:

    LATEST_TAG="$(git tag --list 'debian/*' --sort=version:refname | grep -v -E '_bpo[0-9]' | tail -n1)"
    git merge --no-ff "${LATEST_TAG}"

Just pay attention that you didn't merge some unwanted version from
Debian experimental!

# Prepare a branch for upstream

Prepare a branch, e.g.:

    UPSTREAM_FEATURE_BRANCH=silence-tor-browser-apparmor-logs
    git checkout -b "${UPSTREAM_FEATURE_BRANCH}" upstream-repo/master

Edit `apparmor/torbrowser.Browser.firefox`, adding changes that are
supposed to go upstream , and commit. Then:

    TAILS_FEATURE_BRANCH=feature/14606-silence-tor-browser-apparmor-logs
    git checkout -b "${TAILS_FEATURE_BRANCH}" origin/master
    git merge "${UPSTREAM_FEATURE_BRANCH}"

Again, edit `apparmor/torbrowser.Browser.firefox`, now adding changes
that are Tails-specific, and commit. Then push:

    git push -u origin "${UPSTREAM_FEATURE_BRANCH}" "${TAILS_FEATURE_BRANCH}"

Then submit `TAILS_FEATURE_BRANCH` for review on the Tails'
side, and ask the reviewer to submit `UPSTREAM_FEATURE_BRANCH` as a
pull request to
[upstream](https://github.com/micahflee/torbrowser-launcher/) once s/he
is happy with its state (alternatively, the reviewer reminds the patch
submitter to send it).
