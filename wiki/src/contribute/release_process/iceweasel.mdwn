New Firefox release
===================

If Iceweasel was not updated to match the new Firefox release we want,
a bit more work is needed.
* Download the Firefox tarball and detached signature.
* Check the signature.
* Put the tarball in the parent directory of your Iceweasel Git repository.
* Extract the tarball.
* `cd` into the extracted directory.
* Copy the `debian/` directory from our previous package into the new
  upstream source directory.
* Use `dch` to add a `debian/changelog` entry matching the new
  upstream version. Use 0 for the Debian packaging version, e.g.
  `17.0.5esr-0`, to leave room for the official packaging that we will
  want to merge when it's out.
* Download and repack the other tarballs:

  	make -f debian/rules download

* `cd` into our Iceweasel Git directory.
* Checkout the `tails/master` branch.
* Get yourself a new upstream branch:

  	git branch -D upstream
  	git branch upstream tails/master

* Trick the tarball importer to import the correct version:

  	cp ../mozilla-esr17/browser/config/version.txt browser/config/ && \
  	cp ../mozilla-esr17/debian/changelog debian/

* Import the new upstream release into the `upstream` branch:

  	make -f debian/rules import

* Merge the import commit into `tails/master`:

  	git reset --hard && \
	git merge upstream

* Get the `debian` directory back:

  	git checkout HEAD^ -- debian
  	git commit -m 'Get Debian packaging directory back.'

* Cleanup quilt status:

  	rm -rf .pc

* Apply all quilt patches:

  	quilt push -a

* `git rm` files deleted by quilt patches

* `git add` files created by quilt patches

* Commit:

  	git commit -a -m 'Apply all quilt patches.'

New iceweasel release
=====================

The way to proceed is different depending on whether Debian's
iceweasel was pushed to it yet, or not.

If Debian's iceweasel was pushed to Git already
-----------------------------------------------

FIXME: add missing steps to merge iceweasel's updated Git.

If Debian's iceweasel was not pushed to Git yet
-----------------------------------------------

FIXME: test these instructions.

Then, we have to import the source package into Git ourselves, and
merge from Debian's Vcs-Git later.

* Download, verify and extract the new iceweasel source package with dget.

* Checkout our `tails/master` branch.

* Overwrite the files in the Git checkout with the new ones.
  Assuming the new extracted iceweasel package is in
  `iceweasel-17.0.2esr`, and our iceweasel Git repository checkout is
  in `git`:

  	rsync --stats -a --exclude=.git --delete iceweasel-17.0.2esr/ git/

* `git add` the new files and the modified ones

* `git rm` the deleted files

* Commit.

* Verify with `diff` that the current state of the `tails/master` is
  exactly the same as Debian's iceweasel source package one.

* Bring our `debian/changelog` and `debian/rules` changes back.

Update Torbrowser patches
=========================

* Make sure all quilt patches are applied.
* Unapply all Torbrowser patches: use `quilt pop` as many times
  as needed.
* Remove all Torbrowser patches from the series:

  	quilt unapplied | xargs -n 1 quilt delete

* Remove Torbrowser patches from Git:

  	git rm -r debian/patches/torbrowser/

* Commit:

  	git commit -a -m 'Remove Torbrowser patches.'

* Import the latest TBB patches:

  	export TBB_SRC=XXX_PATH_TO_TBB_SRC_XXX
  	for patch in $(\ls --reverse ${TBB_SRC}/src/current-patches/firefox/*.patch) ; do
  	  p=$(basename "$patch")
  	  quilt import -P "torbrowser/$p" "$patch"
  	done
  	git add debian/patches/torbrowser debian/patches/series
  	TBB_COMMIT=$(git --git-dir=$TBB_SRC/.git rev-parse HEAD)
  	git commit -a -m "Import Torbrowser patches at commit ${TBB_COMMIT}."

* Remove from the quilt series, using `quilt delete`, the Torbrowser
  patches we don't want: see `debian/changelog` for the list of
  patches skipped last time, see the TBB Git log to make your opinion
  about new or updated patches, use common sense. Commit with
  a message explaining your decisions.

* Apply Torbrowser patches:

  	quilt push -a && git commit -a -m 'Apply Torbrowser patches.'

Build packages
==============

Update debian/changelog
-----------------------

* set a version such as `17.0.5esr-0+tails1`
* list our changes, especially the TBB commit at which the
  patches were imported, and the ones we skipped
* set distribution to unstable
* commit:

  	git commit debian/changelog \
  	    -m "$(head -n 1 debian/changelog | sed -e 's,).*,),')"

Tag the release
---------------

	git tag -s -m "$(head -n 1 debian/changelog | sed -e 's,).*,),')" $TAG_NAME

Build for unstable
------------------

If you have no available non-Tails setup to comfortably test these
packages, then skip this step.

* Build for unstable and the architecture you can test on (most likely
  amd64).
* Install and test the resulting packages.

Build for squeeze-backports
---------------------------

* Checkout the `tails/squeeze` branch.
* Merge the tag.
* Add a backport changelog entry:

  	dch --bpo

* Commit:

  	git commit debian/changelog \
  	    -m "$(head -n 1 debian/changelog | sed -e 's,).*,),')"

* Tag the backport:

  	git tag -s -m "$(head -n 1 debian/changelog | sed -e 's,).*,),')" $TAG_NAME

* Build for squeeze-backports and i386, e.g. in our debomatic instance.
* Test the resulting packages in Tails.
* Make sure the `.orig.*` tarballs are included in the `.changes`
  file. FIXME: check if that's needed, or done automatically by the
  above instructions.
* Upload the resulting packages to the relevant suite of our
  [[contribute/APT repository]].
