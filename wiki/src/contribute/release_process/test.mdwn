# Changes

Keeping an eye on the changes between released versions is one of the
many safeguards against releasing crap.

## Source


Compare the to-be-released source code with previous version's one e.g.:

Boot the candidate image and find the commit it was build from with the
`tails-version` command.

Then, from the source tree, see the diff:

	git diff --find-renames <old image commit>..<candidate image commit>

e.g. `git diff --find-renames 334e1c485a3a79be9fff899d4dc9d2db89cdc9e1..cfbde80925fdd0af008f10bc90c8a91a578c58e3`

## Result

Compare the list of bundled packages and versions with the one shipped last
time. `.packages` are usually attached to the email announcing the image is ready.

	/usr/bin/diff -u \
	    wiki/src/torrents/files/tails-amd64-3.1.packages \
	    tails-amd64-3.2.packages \
	    | wdiff --diff-input  --terminal

Check the output for:

- new packages that may cause harm or make the images unnecessarily
  big
- packages that could be erroneously removed
- new versions of software we might not have audited yet (including:
  does the combination of our configuration with software X version
  Y+1 achieve the same wished results as with software X version Y?)

## Image size

Check the images size has not changed much since the last release.

In a directory with many Tails ISO and USB images:

    find \( -iname "tails*.iso" -o -iname "tails*.img" \) \
	     -type f -exec ls -l --block-size=M '{}' \; | sort -rhk 5

<a id="reproducibility-final-check"></a>

# Reproducibility

This section can **not** be done by the RM.

1. Download the ISO and USB images.

2. Clear-sign the hashes of all products using your OpenPGP key
   and gzip the output (otherwise the signed text could be mangled
   at some point in the email chain):

        DEST_DIR=$(mktemp -d)
        sha512sum *.iso *.img \
          | gpg --clear-sign \
          | gzip \
          > "$DEST_DIR/TR-bits.gz"

3. Locate the file generated by the command above. To display its location,
   execute the following command:

        echo "$DEST_DIR/TR-bits.gz"

4. Send the aforementioned generated file as an attachment
   to the _Trusted Reproducer_, whose name is on the
   [release calendar](https://tails.boum.org/contribute/calendar/).

5. If the _Trusted Reproducer_ is around, ask them:

    - if they've received your email
    - if they could successfully decompress the attachment
    - if they could check the inline signature of the attachment once decompressed
    - if the signed text contains all the information they need

# Automated test suite

Our long term goal is to eliminate the manual test suite (except the
parts which require real hardware) and have the automated test suite
run all our tests. Its design, and how to write new tests, are
documented on a [[dedicated page|test/automated_tests]].

## Running the automated test suite

See [[test/setup]] and [[test/usage]].

Do point `--old-iso` to the ISO image of the previous stable release.

## Automated test suite migration progress

The manual test suite below either contains tests that cannot be
automated, has no automated test implemented yet, or has a test
implemented, but it either hasn't been reviewed, had a confirmed pass
by someone other than the test author, or has issues. The latter is
tracked by tickets prefixed with `todo/test_suite:`.

# Tor Browser

## Miscellaneous functionality

* Test if _uBlock_ works:
  - The _uBlock_ icon must be visible.
  - Visit a website that normally displays ads, such as
    <https://www.nytimes.com/>. The ads should not be displayed and
    the uBlock icon should display a strictly positive number of
    blocked elements.

## Security and fingerprinting

* Run the [tests the Tor Browser folks
  use](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/build/BuildSignoff#TestPagestoUse)
  and compare to the last released version of Tails. Results should
  not be worse.
  (automate: [[!tails_ticket 10260]])
  - For the "evercookie" test to work, you may have to disable
    _uBlock_ on its web page.
* Compare the fingerprint Tor Browser in Tails with the fingerprint of
  the same version of Tor Browser (running on Linux outside of Tails), using at least
  <https://panopticlick.eff.org/> (automate: [[!tails_ticket 10262]]).
  Click "Show full results for fingerprinting" to see the details
  we're interested in.
  - The exposed User-Agent should match the latest Tor Browser's one.
  - Ignore the result of the "blocking tracking ads" and "blocking
    invisible trackers" tests, which seem unreliable (we've seen
    different results for the very same version of Tor Browser).
  - Update the *Browser fingerprint* section of the
    [[known issues|support/known_issues]] if needed.
* WebRTC should be disabled: (automate: [[!tails_ticket 10264]])
  - In `about:config` check that `media.peerconnection.enabled` is set to
    `false`.
  - <http://mozilla.github.io/webrtc-landing/>, especially the `getUserMedia`
    test. It's expected that the audio test works if you agree to share a
    microphone with the remote website; anything else should fail.
  - <http://net.ipcalf.com/> should display _literally_
    `ifconfig | grep inet | grep -v inet6 | cut -d" " -f2 | tail -n1`
* The content of `/etc/default/htpdate.user-agent` should match should produce
  the User-Agent used in the Tor Browser. (automate: [[!tails_ticket 10268]])

<a id="Thunderbird"></a>

# Thunderbird

## Onion services

To test that Onion service support works:

1. Configure an IMAP email account using auto-discovered (non-Onion) server settings
   using a provide that also provides onion services for IMAP, POP, and SMTP:
   for example, riseup.net
2. In Preferences → Account Settings → Server Settings, switch the Server Name
   to the email provider's onion service (e.g. Riseup, 5gdvpfoh6kb2iqbizb37lzk2ddzrwa47m6rpdueg2m656fovmbhoptqd.onion on port 993 with SSL).
3. In Preferences → Account Settings → Outgoing Server (SMTP), switch
   the Server Name
   to the email provider's onion service (see above, on port 465 with SSL).
4. Check email over IMAP.
5. Send an email and verify it's received.
6. Repeat the process with POP (see above, on port 995 with SSL) instead of IMAP.

## EHLO/HELO

To check that the EHLO/HELO SMTP message is not leaking anything
at the application level:

1. Start Thunderbird using the GNOME Applications menu.
2. Configure the outgoing SMTP server for an email account
   so it uses STARTTLS on port 587
   (Thunderbird will send two EHLO/HELO: one before TLS is
   initiated; one after; the assumption here is that Thunderbird will
   send the same both times).
3. Run `sudo tcpdump -n -i lo -w dump` while sending an email to
   capture the packets before Tor encrypts it, then close
   tcpdump. Note that the packet containing EHLO/HELO will be sent
   really early, so even if the email failed (e.g. because the mail
   server doesn't support plaintext SMTP on port 587) we are ok.
4. Check the dump for the HELO/EHLO message and
   verify that it only contains `127.0.0.1`:
   `sudo tcpdump -A -r dump | grep EHLO`

# Tor

* The version of Tor should be the latest stable one, which is the highest version number
  before alpha releases on <https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org/pool/main/t/tor/>. (automate:
  [[!tails_ticket 10259]])

# WhisperBack

* I should be able to send a bug report with WhisperBack.
* When we receive this bug report on the tails-bugs mailing list,
  Schleuder tells us that it was sent encrypted.

# Root access control

1. Start the candidate Tails image.
2. Do *not* set an administration password.
3. Check you cannot login as root with `/bin/su` neither with the `amnesia` password nor
  with the `live` one. (automate: [[!tails_ticket 10274]])

# Virtualization support

* Test that Tails starts and the browser launches in VirtualBox.

# APT (automate: [[!tails_ticket 17017 desc="#17017"]])

     grep -r jenw7xbd6tf7vfhp.onion /etc/apt/sources.list*

* Make sure the Tails repository suite in matching the release tag (for example
  the release version number) is in APT sources.
* Make sure the Tails repository unversioned suites (e.g. `testing`,
  `stable` and `devel`) are *not* in APT sources.

<a id="incremental-upgrades"></a>

# Incremental upgrades

* List the versions from which an upgrade path to this one is described.
  On the up-to-date `master` branch in a local
  [[clone of the Tails Git repository|contribute/git#main-repo]]:

      git grep -E -l "  version: '?0.23'?" \
          wiki/src/upgrade/v1/Tails/*/*/test/upgrades.yml

  … replacing "0.23" with the version you are testing.

* For each description file, open it and verify if it allows incremental upgrade
  or only full upgrade.

* For each previous version from which an upgrade path is described, install it
  and try to upgrade:
  * For every incremental upgrade path: make sure the resulting updated
    system "works fine" (boots, pretends to be the correct version,
    and the following components work fine: Tor, Tor Browser, Unsafe Browser).
  * For upgrade paths that only propose a full upgrade: make sure the
    user is told to do a manual upgrade.

  If:

  * the update-description files have been published on the
    *test* channel already (see <https://tails.boum.org/upgrade/v1/Tails/>)
  * and the IUK has been published already (see
    <https://archive.torproject.org/amnesia.boum.org/tails/alpha/>
    and <https://archive.torproject.org/amnesia.boum.org/tails/stable/>):

  then:

        sudo sh -c 'sed -i /^TAILS_CHANNEL=/d /etc/os-release &&
                    echo TAILS_CHANNEL=\"test\" >> /etc/os-release' && \
        systemctl --user restart tails-upgrade-frontend.service

  Else, use a local test setup:

  * A web server on the LAN.
  * A copy of `wiki/src/upgrade` from the `stable` or `testing` branch,
    for example in `/var/www/tails/upgrade/v1/Tails/3.14~rc2/amd64/stable/updates.yml`
  * A copy of the `iuk` directory of our HTTP mirrors,
    for example in `/var/www/tails/stable/iuk/Tails_amd64_3.14-rc2_to_3.14.iuk`.

    To synchronize your local copy:

        torsocks rsync -rt --progress --delete mirrors.rsync.tails.boum.org::amnesia-archive/tails/stable/iuk/ /var/www/tails/stable/iuk/

  * Patch `/etc/hosts` in Tails to point to your web server:

        echo "192.168.1.4    dl.amnesia.boum.org" | sudo tee --append /etc/hosts

  * Patch sudo configuration to allow passing arbitrary arguments to
    `tails-upgrade-frontend`:

        sudo sed -i \
            -e 's,/usr/bin/tails-upgrade-frontend ""$,/usr/bin/tails-upgrade-frontend,' \
            /etc/sudoers.d/zzz_upgrade

  * Run the upgrader. It must be called, from inside the system to upgrade,
    with every needed option to use the local web server rather than the
    online one, for example:

        DISABLE_PROXY=1 SSL_NO_VERIFY=1 \
        tails-upgrade-frontend-wrapper --override-baseurl \
        http://192.168.1.4/tails

# Tails Verification

* The goal is to check that *Tails Verification* works in *Tor
  Browser* in the version of Tails we are testing here. *Tails
  Verification* only supports verifying the current release so for
  example, when doing tests for the Tails 3.13 release, we use it in
  the tentative Tails 3.13 to verify the Tails 3.12 ISO and USB images.

  1. Start the Tails that you are testing.

  2. Start *Tor Browser*.

  3. Visit <https://tails.boum.org/install/download-iso/>.

  4. If you already have the ISO image for the last, already released
     version of Tails, i.e. the one that's advertised in the sidebar
     of our production website, then click "*I already downloaded Tails $N*".
     Otherwise follow the instructions on that web page to download
     the ISO image.

  5. Install *Tails Verification*.

  6. Click the **Verify Tails $N** button.

  7. The verification should be successful.

  8. Repeat for the USB image, except the URL for step (3) is:
     <https://tails.boum.org/install/download/>

# Real (non-VM) hardware

`[can't-automate]`

Note that for release candidates, we do not always optimize the ordering
of files in the SquashFS, which might make them boot somewhat slower.

### USB

1. Boot this USB stick on bare-metal a first time to trigger re-partitioning.
2. Boot this USB stick a second time, measuring the boot time (from the
   syslinux menu until the GNOME desktop is ready -- quickly press
   ENTER in the Greeter).
3. Compare with the boot time of the previous Tails version. The new
   one should not be significantly slower to start.

### DVD

1. Boot on bare-metal from DVD, measuring the boot time (from the
   syslinux menu until the GNOME desktop is ready -- quickly press
   ENTER in the Greeter).
3. Compare with the boot time of the previous Tails version. The new
   one should not be significantly slower to start.

# Documentation

* The "Tails documentation" desktop launcher should open the
  [[doc]] page (automate: [[!tails_ticket 8788]]):
  - in one language to which the website is translated
  - in one language to which the website is not translated: this
    should open the page in English
* Browse around in the documentation shipped in the image and check
  that internal links work fine (automate: [[!tails_ticket 10254]]):

        file:///usr/share/doc/tails/website/index.en.html

# Internationalization

Boot and check basic functionality is working for our [[best supported
(Tier-1) languages|contribute/how/translate#tier-1-languages]].

You *really* have to reboot between each language.

* The chosen keyboard layout must be applied. (automate: [[!tails_ticket 10261]])
  This is known to be broken in some languages, such as Arabic:
  [[!tails_ticket 12638]].
* The screen keyboard must (automate: [[!tails_ticket 10263]]):
  - work in Tor Browser when activated after the browser has started;
  - work in Thunderbird when activated after Thunderbird has started;
  - be auto-configured to use the same keyboard layout as the
    X session (known exceptions: Chinese, Persian, Português,
    Russian, Tiếng Việt).
* In the Tor Browser:
  - DuckDuckGo must be the default, pre-selected search plugin. (automate: [[!tails_ticket 10265]])

## Spellchecking

To see which among the supported locales there should be a
spellchecker, run this in a Tails Git checkout of the commit the
release under testing was built from:

    git grep -E '^hunspell' config/chroot_local-packageslists/tails-common.list

Then do the follow in the same Tor Browser session running in the
`en_US.UTF-8` locale (or whatever locale you are most comfortable
identifying other language names in):

* Check that the expected languages are listed in the list of languages for
  spell checking. (automate: [[!tails_ticket 10269]])
  - Visit <https://translate.google.com/>.
  - Right-click and choose "Check spelling".
  - Right-click and check the list of available languages.
* For a few languages, check the spell checking:
  - Type something in the textarea.
  - Right-click and select a language.
  - Verify that the spelling suggestion are from that language. (automate: [[!tails_ticket 10271]])

# Misc

* Check that all seems well during init: (automate: [[!tails_ticket 10277]])
  - `systemctl --failed --all` should say `0 loaded units listed`
  - the output of `sudo journalctl` should seem OK.
