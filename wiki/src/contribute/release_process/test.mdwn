# Changes

Keeping an eye on the changes between released versions is one of the
many safeguards against releasing crap.

## Source


Compare the to-be-released source code with previous version's one e.g.:

Boot the candidate ISO and find the commit it was build from with the
`tails-version` command.

Then, from the source tree, see the diff:

	git diff --find-renames <old tag>..<ISO commit>

e.g. `git diff 0.17..06fa1ab80d55c9f29274b7459bd198edb1a8d53d`

## Result

Compare the list of bundled packages and versions with the one shipped last
time. `.packages` are usually attached to the email announcing the ISO is ready.

	/usr/bin/diff -u \
	    wiki/src/torrents/files/tails-i386-0.16.packages \
	    tails-i386-0.17.packages \
	    | wdiff --diff-input  --terminal

Check the output for:

- new packages that may cause harm or make the images unnecessarily
  big
- packages that could be erroneously removed
- new versions of software we might not have audited yet (including:
  does the combination of our configuration with software X version
  Y+1 achieve the same wished results as with software X version Y?)

## Image size

Check the image size has not changed much since the last release.

In a directory with many Tails ISO images:

    find -iname "tails*.iso" -exec ls -lh '{}' \; | sort -rhk 8

# Automated test suite

Our long term goal is to eliminate the manual test suite (except the
parts which require real hardware) and have the automated test suite
run all our tests. It's design, and how to write new tests, are
documented on a [[dedicated page|test/automated_tests]].

## Running the automated test suite

See [[test/setup]] and [[test/usage]].

## Automated test suite migration progress

The manual test suite below either contains tests that cannot be
automated, has no automated test implemented yet, or has a test
implemented, but it either hasn't been reviewed, had a confirmed pass
by someone other than the test author, or has issues. The latter is
tracked by tickets prefixed with `todo/test_suite:`.

# Iceweasel

## Security and fingerprinting

* Run the [tests the TBB folks
  use](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/build/BuildSignoff#TestPagestoUse).
* Compare the fingerprint of Tails and the latest TBB using at least
  <https://panopticlick.eff.org/>
  - The exposed User-Agent should match the latest TBB's one.
  - Update the [[fingerprint section|support/known_issues#fingerprint]] of the
    known issues page if needed.
* WebRTC should be disabled:
  - In `about:config` check that `media.peerconnection.enabled` is set to
    `false`.
  - <http://mozilla.github.io/webrtc-landing/>, especially the `getUserMedia`
    test. It's expected that the audio test works if you agree to share a
    microphone with the remote website; anything else should fail.
  - <http://net.ipcalf.com/> should display
    `ifconfig | grep inet | grep -v inet6 | cut -d" " -f2 | tail -n1`
* One should be able to switch identities from the web browser.
* Running `getTorBrowserUserAgent` should produce the User-Agent set by the
  installed version of Torbutton, and used in Iceweasel.

## Functionality

* Browsing (by IP) a HTTP or HTTPS server on the LAN should be possible.
* Browsing (by IP) a FTP server on the LAN should be possible.

# Pidgin

* pidgin: is an IRC session really torified?
 - if you are running an IRC server: check there
 - else: see if the connection to the IRC server appears in Vidalia
   connections list
* Check OTR is working.
* Check that IRC is working with the default OFTC profile.
* Check that XMPP is working with a new test profile.
* Check if pidgin doesn't leak too many informations on replying to different
  CTCP requests:
  * Start Tails, launch pidgin, and join #tails.
  * Also join #tails from the webchat of OFTC on <https://webchat.oftc.net/>
    using another nickname.
  * Try to send `/ctcp <Tails_account_nick> COMMAND` from the webchat to pidgin:
    - You should get no answer apart for the commands listed in [[!tails_ticket
      5823]].
    - List of `/ctcp` commands, see [this page](http://www.wikkedwire.com/irccommands):
      - PING
      - VERSION
      - FINGER
      - USERINFO
      - CLIENTINFO
      - TIME

# Tor

* The version of Tor should be the latest stable one, which is the highest version number
  before alpha releases on <http://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org/pool/main/t/tor/>.
* firewall: is the Tor-enforcement effective?
 - check output of `iptables -L -n -v`
 - check output of `iptables -t nat -L -n -v`
 - try connecting to the Internet after unsetting `$http_proxy` and
   `$HTTP_PROXY` using a piece of software that does not obey the
   GNOME proxy settings, *and* is not explicitly torified in Tails:
   `unset http_proxy ; unset HTTP_PROXY ; wget --no-proxy
   http://monip.org` (should result in a "`Connection refused`".
* firewall: is IPv6 traffic blocked?
 - check output of `ip6tables -L -n`
 - at a place with working IPv6: try connecting to a known-working
   IPv6-enabled server on its IPv6 address over TCP and icmp6.
* is `/etc/resolv.conf` OK both before/after DHCP has been set up? it should
  *always* read `nameserver 127.0.0.1`
* [[doc/first_steps/startup_options/bridge_mode]] should work:
  1. Set up an administrator password.
  1. Enable network configuration in Tails Greeter.
  1. Configure a bridge or a few in Tor Launcher:
     - `bridge 198.252.153.59:9001`
     - `obfs2 198.252.153.59:16492`
     - `obfs3 198.252.153.59:16493`
  1. Use the Internet.
  1. Check with `sudo watch "netstat -taupen | grep ESTABLISHED"` that the only outgoing
     direct network connections go to the configured bridges.
* Verify that all destinations reached from an intensive Tails session
  are tor routers or
  authorities:
  1. Boot Tails without the network in.
  1. Set up an administration password.
  1. Start dumping your whole session's network activity with `sudo
     tcpdump -n -i any -w dump` (or better, do the dump on another machine,
     or on the host OS if Tails is running in a VM).
  1. Plug the network.
  1. Wait for Tor to be functional.
  1. Save `/var/lib/tor/cached-microdesc-consensus` out of the VM (it's needed
     to analyze the network dump later on).
  1. Do *a lot* of network stuff (why not run do this while doing all
     the other tests **but** I2P and the unsafe browser, which would
     show many false positives?)
  1. Then check all destinations, e.g. by using tshark and the script below:

         # set DUMP to the output of tcpdump above
         DUMP=dump
         # set CONSENSUS to Tor's consensus from the Tails session
         CONSENSUS=cached-microdesc-consensus
         NODES=$(mktemp)
         awk '/^r / { print $6 }' ${CONSENSUS} > ${NODES}
         # Note that these default directory authorities may change! To be
         # sure, check in Tor's source, src/or/config.c:~900
         DIR_AUTHS="
         128.31.0.39
         86.59.21.38

             if echo ${DIR_AUTHS} | grep -qe "${ip_expr}"; then
                 continue
             fi
             if ! grep -qe "^${ip_expr}$" ${NODES}; then
                 echo "${x} is bad"
             fi
         done
         rm ${NODES}

     Note that this script will produce some false positives, like your
     gateway, broadcasts, etc.

## Stream isolation

See our [[stream isolation design
page|contribute/design/stream_isolation]] for details such as port
numbers, that are not duplicated here to avoid desynchronization.

Assumptions for the following tests: first, Tor stream isolation
features properly do their work; second, our `torrc` sets the right
`SocksPort` options to implement what we want.

**Note**: the following commands would advantageously be replaced with
the appropriate tcpdump or tshark filters.

* Make sure Claws Mail use its dedicated `SocksPort` when connecting
  to IMAP / POP3 / SMTP servers. As root:

      watch -n 0.1 'netstat -taupen | grep claws'

* Make sure these use the `SocksPort` dedicated for Tails-specific applications:
  - htpdate — as root, run:

        service htpdate stop \
           && rm -f /var/run/htpdate/{done,success} \
           && service htpdate start

    ... with the following command running as root in another
    terminal:

        watch -n 0.1 'netstat -taupen | grep curl'

  - security check — run `tails-security-check` with the following
    command running as root in another terminal:

        watch -n 0.1 'netstat -taupen | grep perl'

  - incremental upgrades — run `tails-upgrade-frontend-wrapper` with
    the following command running as root in another terminal:

        watch -n 0.1 'netstat -taupen | grep perl'

* Make sure iceweasel uses its dedicated `SocksPort`: quit Iceweasel
  then start it with the following command running as root in another
  terminal:

      watch -n 0.1 'netstat -taupen | grep iceweasel'

* Make sure other applications use the default system-wide
  `SocksPort`:
  - Polipo — run:

        wget https://tails.boum.org/

    ... with the following command running as root in another
    terminal:

        watch -n 0.1 'netstat -taupen | grep polipo'

  - Gobby 0.4 — start Gobby 0.4 from the *Applications* menu and
    connect to a server, with the following command running as root in
    another terminal:

        watch -n 0.1 'netstat -taupen | grep gobby'

  - Gobby 0.5 — start Gobby 0.5 from the *Applications* menu and
    connect to a server (for example `gobby.debian.org`), with the following command running as root in
    another terminal:

        watch -n 0.1 'netstat -taupen | grep gobby'

  - SSH — run (no need to authenticate the server or to login):

        ssh lizard.tails.boum.org

    ... with the following command running as root in another
    terminal:

        watch -n 0.1 'netstat -taupen | grep -E "connect-proxy|ssh"'

  - whois — run:

        whois example.com

    ... with the following command running as root in another
    terminal:

        watch -n 0.1 'netstat -taupen | grep whois'

* Make sure a random application run using `torify` and `torsocks`
  uses the default system-wide `SocksPort`. Run:

      torify /usr/bin/gobby-0.5

    ... and connect to a server (for example `gobby.debian.org`), with the following command running as
    root in another terminal:

        watch -n 0.1 'netstat -taupen | grep gobby'

    Then do the same test for:

      torsocks /usr/bin/gobby-0.5

# Use of untrusted partitions

* is any local hard-disk swap partition used as swap?
  boot on a (possibly virtual) machine that has a cleartext swap
  partition not managed by LVM. This swap partition must not be used
  by Tails. Run `cat /proc/swaps`.
* is a persistence volume on a local hard-disk partition used?
  (Hint: setup a libvirt USB disk with GPT and a partition labeled
  `TailsData`, set the `removable` flag on it, check that
  tails-greeter proposes to enable persistence. Then remove the
  `removable` flag, and check that tails-greeter does not propose to
  enable persistence anymore.)

# Claws

* Check mail over IMAP using:
  - a "clearnet" IMAP server.
  - a hidden service IMAP server (e.g. TorMail, jhiwjjlqpyawmpjx.onion, or
    Riseup, xyvp43vrggckj427.onion with SSL).
* Send an email using:
  - a "clearnet" SMTP server.
  - a hidden service SMTP server (see above).
* Check that the profile works and is torified:
  1. Send an email using Claws and a non-anonymizing SMTP relay (a
     SMTP relay that writes the IP address of the client it is
     relaying email for in the Received header).
  1. Then check that email's headers once received, especially the
     `Received:` one.
* Also check that the EHLO/HELO SMTP message is not leaking anything
  at the application level:
  1. Start Claws using the panel icon.
  2. Disable SSL/TLS for SMTP in Claws (so take precautions for not
     leaking your password in plaintext by either changing it
     temporarily or using a disposable account).
  3. Run `sudo tcpdump -n -i lo -w dump` to capture the packets before
     Tor encrypts it, then close tcpdump
  4. Check the dump for the HELO/EHLO message and
     verify that it only contains `localhost`: `tcpdump -A -r dump`
  5. Check the `Received:` and `Message-Id` fields in the received
     message: it must not leak the hostname, nor the local IP.

# WhisperBack

* can a bug report e-mail be sent?
* is it correctly encrypted?

# Time

1. Boot Tails without a network cable connected.
   (e.g. `virsh domif-setlink tails-dev 52:54:00:05:17:62 down`.)
2. Set an administration password.
3. set the time to an obviously wrong one:

           date --set="Mon, 01 Mar 2000 15:45:34 - 0800"

4. Connect the network cable.
   (e.g. `virsh domif-setlink tails-dev 52:54:00:05:17:62 up`)

=> the date should be corrected and Tor/Vidalia should start
correctly.

# Erase memory on shutdown

- check that `memlockd` is running
- check that `udev-watchdog` monitors the right device ([[!tails_ticket 5560]])
  * on USB
  * on DVD
- After booting from DVD, remove Tails boot medium and check that the
  memory erasure process is started (`Loading new kernel`, at least).
  [[!tails_ticket 5472]]
- After booting from USB, remove Tails boot medium and check that the
  memory erasure process is started (`Loading new kernel`, at least).

# Root access control

* Check you can login as root with `su` neither with the `amnesia` password nor
  with the `live` one.
* Check that the `$TAILS_USER_PASSWORD` variable, if still existing in the system
  environment after the boot has finished, does not contain the clear text
  password.

# Virtualization support

* Test that Tails starts and the browser launches in VirtualBox.

# I2P

* Make sure that I2P is up-to-date, at least if the
  [changelogs](https://geti2p.net/en/blog/) mention that
  security critical bugs were fixed.
* Check that "Applications -> Internet -> I2P" works:
  - You get the "Starting I2P..." pop-up.
  - The router console opens in Iceweasel upon success.
  - You get the "I2P failed to start" pop-up on failure (e.g. no
    network so tordate failed).
* Check that I2P connects to the network:
  - Go to <http://127.0.0.1:7657/i2ptunnelmgr>
  - You should get "Network: Hidden" in the "General" section.
  - The numbers in the "Peers" section of the sidebar should be non-zero.
* Check that you can reach some eepsites within Iceweasel, like
  <http://i2p-projekt.i2p> and <http://forum.i2p>.
* Check that you can connect to the I2P IRC server through Pidgin and
  the preconfigured IRC account on 127.0.0.1.

# Git

* clone a repository over `git://`
* clone a repository over `https://`
* clone a repository over SSH

# SSH

* Connecting over SSH to a server on the Internet should work (and
  appear in Vidalia's connections list).
* Connecting (by IP) over SSH to a server on the LAN should work.
* Connecting to a sftp server on the Internet using GNOME's "Connect
  to a server" should work.

# APT

     grep -r deb.tails.boum.org /etc/apt/sources.list*

* Make sure the Tails repository suite in matching the release tag (for example
  the release version number) is in APT sources.
* Make sure the Tails repository unversioned suites (e.g. `testing`,
  `stable` and `devel`) are *not* in APT sources.

<a id="incremental-upgrades"></a>

# Incremental upgrades

* List the versions from which an upgrade paths to this one is described.
  In the `stable` or `testing` branch:

      git grep -l "  version: '0.23'" wiki/src/upgrade/

* For each description file, open it and verify if it allows incremental upgrade
  or only full upgrade.

* For each previous version from which an upgrade paths is described, install it
  and try to upgrade:
  * For every incremental upgrade path: make sure the resulting updated
    system "works fine" (boots and pretends to be the correct version).
  * For upgrade paths that only propose a full upgrade: make sure the
    user is told to do a manual upgrade.

  If the IUKs and update-description files have been published on the
  *alpha* channel already (see
  <https://archive.torproject.org/amnesia.boum.org/tails/alpha/>):

      echo 'TAILS_CHANNEL="alpha"' | sudo tee --append /etc/os-release && \
      tails-upgrade-frontend-wrapper

  Else, use a local test setup:

  * A web server on the LAN.
  * A copy of `wiki/src/update` from the `stable` or `testing` branch,
    for example in `/var/www/tails/update/v1/Tails/0.14~rc2/i386/stable/updates.yml`
  * A copy of the `iuk` directory of our HTTP mirrors,
    for example in `/var/www/tails/stable/iuk/Tails_i386_0.14-rc2_to_0.14.iuk`.

    To synchronize your local copy:

        usewithtor rsync -rt --progress rsync.torproject.org::amnesia-archive/tails/stable/iuk/ /var/www/tails/stable/iuk/

  * Patch `/etc/hosts` in Tails to point to your web server:

        192.168.1.4    dl.amnesia.boum.org

  * Call the upgrader must be called, from inside the system to upgrade,
    with every needed option to use the local web server rather than the
    online one, for example:

        DISABLE_PROXY=1 SSL_NO_VERIFY=1 \
        tails-upgrade-frontend-wrapper --override-baseurl \
        http://192.168.1.4/tails

# Windows Camouflage

Enable Windows XP camouflage via the Tails Greeter checkbox and:

* Tails OpenPGP Applet's context menu should look readable
* iceweasel should use a Internet Explorer theme

# Unsafe Web Browser

* On start, if no DNS server was configured in NetworkManager
  (e.g. if there's no network connection), there must be an error.
* Once started, check that:
  - it has no scary red theme when Windows Camouflage is activated.
  - the iceweasel instance runs as the `clearnet` user.
  - it has no proxy configured.
  - no extensions are installed.
  - there are no bookmarks.
* On exit, check that:
  - make sure that its chroot gets properly teared down on exit (there
    should be nothing mounted inside `/var/lib/unsafe-browser`).

# Real (non-VM) hardware

`[can't-automate]`

* Boot on bare-metal on USB.
* Boot on bare-metal on DVD.
* Measure boot time (from syslinux menu the GNOME dektop ready - quickly press
  enter in the greeter), then on some reference bare metal hardware, and
  compare with previous version. The new one should not be significantly
  slower to start.

# Documentation

* Check that links to the online website (`Mirror:`) at the bottom of
  bundled static web pages (`/usr/share/doc/tails/website/`) are working. Else, it probably means the
  wiki was not built with a recent enough ikiwiki.
* Browse around in the documentation shipped in the image. Internal
  links should be fine.

# Internationalization

Boot and check basic functionality is working for every supported
language.

* The chosen keyboard layout must be applied.
* The virtual keyboard must work and be auto-configured to use the same keyboard
  layout as the X session.
* The Startpage search engine must be localized for the languages we ship a
  searchplug for:

      find /etc/iceweasel/searchplugins/locale/ -iname startpage-*.html

* The Wikipedia search engine must be localized for all languages.

## Spellchecking

* Check that every supported language is listed in the list of languages for
  spell checking.
  - Visit <https://translate.google.com/>.
  - Right-click and choose "Check spelling".
  - Right-click and check the list of available languages.
* For a few languages, check the spell checking:
  - Type something in the textarea.
  - Right-click and select a language.
  - Verify that the spelling suggestion are from that language.
* Once [[!tails_ticket 5962]] is fixed, the browser spelling dictionary must be
  localized (for languages that are supported by our branding extension).

# Misc

* Check that Tails Greeter's "more options" screen displays properly
  on a display with 600 px height.
* Check that all seems well during init (mostly that all services
  start without errors), and that dmesg seems ok.
* MAT should be able to clean a PDF file, such as:
  <http://examples.itextpdf.com/results/part3/chapter12/pdf_metadata.pdf>
* Browsing (by hostname) a FTP server on the Internet should be
  possible using GNOME's *Connect to server* feature
  (once [[!tails_ticket 6096]] is fixed)
* The Tails signing key shipped should be up-to-date (that is, neither it nor
  one its subkeys must have expired, or be about to expire any time soon).
  - `gpg --list-keys 1202821CBE2CD9C1`
* The "Report an error" desktop launcher should open the [[support]]
  page (automate: [[!tails_ticket 6904]]).
