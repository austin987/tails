# Changes

Keeping an eye on the changes between released versions is one of the
many safeguards against releasing crap.

## Source


Compare the to-be-released source code with previous version's one e.g.:

Boot the candidate ISO and find the commit it was build from with the
`tails-version` command.

Then, from the source tree, see the diff:

	git diff --find-renames <old ISO commit>..<ISO commit>

e.g. `git diff --find-renames 334e1c485a3a79be9fff899d4dc9d2db89cdc9e1..cfbde80925fdd0af008f10bc90c8a91a578c58e3`

## Result

Compare the list of bundled packages and versions with the one shipped last
time. `.packages` are usually attached to the email announcing the ISO is ready.

	/usr/bin/diff -u \
	    wiki/src/torrents/files/tails-amd64-3.1.packages \
	    tails-amd64-3.2.packages \
	    | wdiff --diff-input  --terminal

Check the output for:

- new packages that may cause harm or make the images unnecessarily
  big
- packages that could be erroneously removed
- new versions of software we might not have audited yet (including:
  does the combination of our configuration with software X version
  Y+1 achieve the same wished results as with software X version Y?)

## Image size

Check the image size has not changed much since the last release.

In a directory with many Tails ISO images:

    find -iname "tails*.iso" -exec ls -lh '{}' \; | sort -rhk 5

<a id="reproducibility-final-check"></a>

# Reproducibility

This section can only be done by the RM.

Clear-sign the hashes of all products using *your personal* OpenPGP
key:

    ( \
        cd "${ISOS:?}" && \
        sha512sum tails-amd64-${VERSION:?}/tails-amd64-${VERSION:?}.iso \
                  Tails_amd64_*_to_${VERSION:?}.iuk \
            | gpg --clear-sign \
    )

and leave the output in this section.

# Automated test suite

Our long term goal is to eliminate the manual test suite (except the
parts which require real hardware) and have the automated test suite
run all our tests. It's design, and how to write new tests, are
documented on a [[dedicated page|test/automated_tests]].

## Running the automated test suite

See [[test/setup]] and [[test/usage]].

Do point `--old-iso` to the ISO of the previous stable release.

## Automated test suite migration progress

The manual test suite below either contains tests that cannot be
automated, has no automated test implemented yet, or has a test
implemented, but it either hasn't been reviewed, had a confirmed pass
by someone other than the test author, or has issues. The latter is
tracked by tickets prefixed with `todo/test_suite:`.

# Tor Browser

## Miscellaneous functionality

* Test if _uBlock_ works:
  - The _uBlock_ icon must be visible.
  - Visit a website that normally displays ads, such is
    <https://www.nytimes.com/>. The ads should not be displayed and
    the uBlock icon should display a strictly positive number of
    blocked elements.

## Security and fingerprinting

* Run the [tests the Tor Browser folks
  use](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/build/BuildSignoff#TestPagestoUse).
  (automate: [[!tails_ticket 10260]])
* Compare the fingerprint of Tails and the latest Tor Browser using at least
  <https://panopticlick.eff.org/> (automate: [[!tails_ticket 10262]])
  - The exposed User-Agent should match the latest Tor Browser's one.
  - Update the *Browser fingerprint* section of the
    [[known issues|support/known_issues]] if needed.
* WebRTC should be disabled: (automate: [[!tails_ticket 10264]])
  - In `about:config` check that `media.peerconnection.enabled` is set to
    `false`.
  - <http://mozilla.github.io/webrtc-landing/>, especially the `getUserMedia`
    test. It's expected that the audio test works if you agree to share a
    microphone with the remote website; anything else should fail.
  - <http://net.ipcalf.com/> should display
    `ifconfig | grep inet | grep -v inet6 | cut -d" " -f2 | tail -n1`
* Running `/usr/local/lib/getTorBrowserUserAgent` should produce the User-Agent set by the
  installed version of Torbutton, and used in the Tor Browser. (automate: [[!tails_ticket 10268]])

# Thunderbird

* Check mail over IMAP using:
  - a hidden service IMAP server (e.g. Riseup, zsolxunfmbfuq7wf.onion with SSL).
* Check mail over POP using:
  - a hidden service POP server (e.g. Riseup, zsolxunfmbfuq7wf.onion with SSL).
* Send an email using:
  - a hidden service SMTP server (see above).

* Check that the profile works and is torified:
  1. Send an email using Thunderbird and a non-anonymizing SMTP relay (a
     SMTP relay that writes the IP address of the client it is
     relaying email for in the Received header).
  1. Then check that email's headers once received, especially the
     `Received:` one.
* Also check that the EHLO/HELO SMTP message is not leaking anything
  at the application level:
  1. Start Thunderbird using the GNOME Applications menu.
  2. Disable SSL/TLS for SMTP in Thunderbird (so take precautions for not
     leaking your password in plaintext by either changing it
     temporarily or using a disposable account). Or better, configure
     StartTLS, since it will send two EHLO/HELO: one before TLS is
     initiated; one after. The assumption here is that Thunderbird will
     send the same both times.
  3. Run `sudo tcpdump -n -i lo -w dump` while sending an email to
     capture the packets before Tor encrypts it, then close
     tcpdump. Note that the packet containing EHLO/HELO will be sent
     really early, so even if the email failed (e.g. because the mail
     server doesn't support plaintext SMTP on port 587) we are ok.
  4. Check the dump for the HELO/EHLO message and
     verify that it only contains `127.0.0.1`:
     `sudo tcpdump -A -r dump | grep EHLO`
* Make sure Thunderbird Mail use its dedicated `SocksPort` (see "SocksPort
  for the MUA" in `/etc/tor/torrc`) when connecting to IMAP / POP3 /
  SMTP servers (both clearnet and hidden services) by monitoring the
  output of this command:

      sudo watch -n 0.1 'ss -taupen | grep thunderbird'

# Tor

* The version of Tor should be the latest stable one, which is the highest version number
  before alpha releases on <http://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org/pool/main/t/tor/>. (automate:
  [[!tails_ticket 10259]])

# WhisperBack

* I should be able to send a bug report with WhisperBack.
* When we receive this bug report on the tails-bugs mailing list,
  Schleuder tells us that it was sent encrypted.

# Root access control

* Check you cannot login as root with `su` neither with the `amnesia` password nor
  with the `live` one. (automate: [[!tails_ticket 10274]])

# Virtualization support

* Test that Tails starts and the browser launches in VirtualBox.

# APT (automate: [[!tails_ticket 8164 desc="#8164"]])

     grep -r jenw7xbd6tf7vfhp.onion /etc/apt/sources.list*

* Make sure the Tails repository suite in matching the release tag (for example
  the release version number) is in APT sources.
* Make sure the Tails repository unversioned suites (e.g. `testing`,
  `stable` and `devel`) are *not* in APT sources.

<a id="incremental-upgrades"></a>

# Incremental upgrades

* List the versions from which an upgrade paths to this one is described.
  In the `stable` or `testing` branch:

      git grep -l "  version: '\?0.23'\?" wiki/src/upgrade/

* For each description file, open it and verify if it allows incremental upgrade
  or only full upgrade.

* For each previous version from which an upgrade paths is described, install it
  and try to upgrade:
  * For every incremental upgrade path: make sure the resulting updated
    system "works fine" (boots, pretends to be the correct version,
    and the following components work fine: Tor, Tor Browser, Unsafe Browser).
  * For upgrade paths that only propose a full upgrade: make sure the
    user is told to do a manual upgrade.

  If:

  * the update-description files have been published on the
    *test* channel already (see <https://tails.boum.org/upgrade/v1/Tails/>)
  * and the IUK has been published already (see
    <https://archive.torproject.org/amnesia.boum.org/tails/alpha/>
    and <https://archive.torproject.org/amnesia.boum.org/tails/stable/>):

  then:

        # Set TAILS_CHANNEL accordingly:
        
        # For actual releases:
        TAILS_CHANNEL=test
        
        # For other (~rc, ~alpha...) releases:
        TAILS_CHANNEL=alpha
        
        # Run:
        echo "TAILS_CHANNEL=\"${TAILS_CHANNEL}\"" | sudo tee --append /etc/os-release && \
        tails-upgrade-frontend-wrapper

  Else, use a local test setup:

  * A web server on the LAN.
  * A copy of `wiki/src/upgrade` from the `stable` or `testing` branch,
    for example in `/var/www/tails/upgrade/v1/Tails/3.14~rc2/amd64/stable/updates.yml`
  * A copy of the `iuk` directory of our HTTP mirrors,
    for example in `/var/www/tails/stable/iuk/Tails_amd64_3.14-rc2_to_3.14.iuk`.

    To synchronize your local copy:

        torsocks rsync -rt --progress --delete rsync.torproject.org::amnesia-archive/tails/stable/iuk/ /var/www/tails/stable/iuk/

  * Patch `/etc/hosts` in Tails to point to your web server:

        echo "192.168.1.4    dl.amnesia.boum.org" | sudo tee --append /etc/hosts

  * Patch sudo configuration to allow passing arbitrary arguments to
    `tails-upgrade-frontend`:

        sudo sed -i \
            -e 's,/usr/bin/tails-upgrade-frontend ""$,/usr/bin/tails-upgrade-frontend,' \
            /etc/sudoers.d/zzz_upgrade

  * Call the upgrader must be called, from inside the system to upgrade,
    with every needed option to use the local web server rather than the
    online one, for example:

        DISABLE_PROXY=1 SSL_NO_VERIFY=1 \
        tails-upgrade-frontend-wrapper --override-baseurl \
        http://192.168.1.4/tails

# Unsafe Web Browser

* Browsing (by IP) a FTP server on the LAN should be possible. (automate: [[!tails_ticket 10252]])

# Tails Verification

* Verify the ISO image of the current release (for example $N=3.7)
  using *Tails Verification* from Tor Browser in the version that you
  are testing (for example $N+1=3.8):

  1. Visit <https://tails.boum.org/install/download/>.

  1. Download the ISO image of the current release (or click "*I already
     downloaded Tails $N*").

  1. Install *Tails Verification*.

  1. Click the **Verify Tails $N** button.

  1. The verification should be successful.

# Real (non-VM) hardware

`[can't-automate]`

* Boot on bare-metal from USB. Measure the boot time (from the
  syslinux menu until the GNOME desktop is ready -- quickly press
  ENTER in the Greeter) and compare with the boot time of the previous
  Tails version. The new one should not be significantly slower to
  start.
* Boot on bare-metal from DVD. Measure the boot time (from the
  syslinux menu until the GNOME desktop is ready -- quickly press
  ENTER in the Greeter) and compare with the boot time of the previous
  Tails version. The new one should not be significantly slower to
  start (for release candidates we do not always update the squashfs
  sort file, so then it might be ok if somewhat slower).

# Documentation

* The "Tails documentation" desktop launcher should open the
  [[getting started]] page (automate: [[!tails_ticket 8788]]):
  - in one language to which the website is translated
  - in one language to which the website is not translated (=> English)
* Browse around in the documentation shipped in the image. Internal
  links should be fine. (automate: [[!tails_ticket 10254]])

# Internationalization

Boot and check basic functionality is working for these (language,
region) tuples:

 - Arabic - Egypt
 - Chinese - China
 - Deutsch - Deutschland
 - English - USA
 - Español - España
 - Français - France
 - Italiano - Italia
 - Persian - Iran
 - Português - Brasil
 - Russian - Russian Federation
 - Tiếng Việt - Vietnam

You *really* have to reboot between each language.

* The chosen keyboard layout must be applied. (automate: [[!tails_ticket 10261]])
* The screen keyboard must (automate: [[!tails_ticket 10263]]):
  - work in Tor Browser when activated after the browser has started;
  - work in Thunderbird when activated after Thunderbird has started;
  - be auto-configured to use the same keyboard layout as the
    X session.
* In the Tor Browser:
  - DuckDuckGo must be the default, pre-selected search plugin. (automate: [[!tails_ticket 10265]])
  - the search plugins must be localized for the expected locales
    (automate: [[!tails_ticket 10267]]).
    
    StartPage should have localized *user interface* for (run this in
    a Tails Git checkout of the commit the release under testing was built
    from):
    
        grep --extended-regexp "[^:]*:[^:]*:[^:]*:[^:]*:[^:]+" \
            config/chroot_local-includes/usr/share/tails/browser-localization/descriptions | \
            sed -n --regexp-extended 's/^([^:]+):.*$/\1/p'
    
    StartPage should have localized *search results* for:
    
        grep --extended-regexp "[^:]*:[^:]*:[^:]*:[^:]+:[^:]*" \
            config/chroot_local-includes/usr/share/tails/browser-localization/descriptions | \
            sed -n --regexp-extended 's/^([^:]+):.*$/\1/p'
    
    DDG should have localized user interface *and* search results, and
    Wikipedia should have a localized plugin, for:
    
        sed -n --regexp-extended 's/^([^:]+):.*$/\1/p' \
            config/chroot_local-includes/usr/share/tails/browser-localization/descriptions

## Spellchecking

To see which among the supported locales there should be no
spellchecker, run this in a Tails Git checkout of the commit the
release under testing was built from:

    git grep NO_SPELLCHECKER_LOCALES= config/chroot_local-hooks/11-localize_browser

Then do the follow in the same Tor Browser session running in the
`en_US.UTF-8` locale (or whatever locale you are most comfortable
identifying other language names in):

* Check that the expected languages are listed in the list of languages for
  spell checking. (automate: [[!tails_ticket 10269]])
  - Visit <https://translate.google.com/>.
  - Right-click and choose "Check spelling".
  - Right-click and check the list of available languages.
* For a few languages, check the spell checking:
  - Type something in the textarea.
  - Right-click and select a language.
  - Verify that the spelling suggestion are from that language. (automate: [[!tails_ticket 10271]])

# Misc

* Check that Tails Greeter's "more options" screen displays properly
  on a display with 600 px height, preferably in a language that's
  more verbose than English (e.g. French). (automate: [[!tails_ticket 10276]])
* Check that all seems well during init: (automate: [[!tails_ticket 10277]])
  - `systemctl --failed --all` should say `0 loaded units listed`
  - the output of `journalctl` should seem OK.
