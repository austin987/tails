[[!meta title="Upgrading the Tor Browser"]]

[[!toc levels=2]]

The big picture
===============

The Tails ISO build system [[!tails_gitweb
config/chroot_local-hooks/10-tbb desc="downloads"]] a set of Tor
Browser tarballs from a location specified in [[!tails_gitweb
config/chroot_local-includes/usr/share/tails/tbb-dist-url.txt]], and
compares their hash with previously verified ones found in
[[!tails_gitweb
config/chroot_local-includes/usr/share/tails/tbb-sha256sums.txt]].

Once released officially, Tor Browser tarballs can be found in
a [permanent (?)
location](https://archive.torproject.org/tor-package-archive/torbrowser/).
However, when upgrading Tor Browser for an imminent Tails release, we
generally have to use Tor Browser tarballs that are under QA and not
officially released yet. So, we have to retrieve them from another,
temporary location, such as
<http://people.torproject.org/~mikeperry/builds/>. If we hard-coded
this temporary URL in `tbb-dist-url.txt`, then our release tag would
only be buildable for as long the tarballs stay in that place, which
at best is a few months.

To solve this, we host ourselves the Tor Browser tarballs we need, and
point to [this permanent
location](http://torbrowser-archive.tails.boum.org/) for anything that
we tag.

Still, one can set an arbitrary download location in
`tbb-dist-url.txt`, which should provide all the flexibility needed
for development purposes.

Upgrade Tor Browser in Tails
============================

Have a look at

* <https://archive.torproject.org/tor-package-archive/torbrowser/?C=M;O=D>
* <https://www.torproject.org/dist/torbrowser/?C=M;O=D>
* <https://people.torproject.org/~gk/builds/?C=M;O=D>
* <https://people.torproject.org/~boklm/builds/?C=M;O=D>

and see if the desired version is available. Set `TBB_DIST_URL` to the
chosen URL, and set `TBB_VERSION` to the desired Tor Browser version, for
example:

    TBB_DIST_URL=https://people.torproject.org/~mikeperry/builds/4.5-build5/
    TBB_VERSION=4.5-build5

<div class="caution">
Ensure you include the "-buildN" part.
</div>

Fetch the version's hash file and its detached signature, and verify
with GnuPG:

    wget ${TBB_DIST_URL:?}/sha256sums-unsigned-build.txt{.asc,} && \
    gpg --verify sha256sums-unsigned-build.txt{.asc,}

Build the list of tarballs we want and their hashes,
so this information is available at build time,
when the tarballs are fetched:

    (
        grep --color=never -E \
            "\stor-browser-linux64-[0-9].*_en-US\.tar\.xz$" \
            sha256sums-unsigned-build.txt \
        && grep --color=never -E \
            "\slangpacks-tor-browser-linux64-.*\.tar\.xz$" \
            sha256sums-unsigned-build.txt \
    ) > config/chroot_local-includes/usr/share/tails/tbb-sha256sums.txt

Then update the URL to the one chosen above:

    echo "${TBB_DIST_URL:?}" | sed "s,^https://,http://," > \
         config/chroot_local-includes/usr/share/tails/tbb-dist-url.txt

<div class="note">
<p>
We cannot use HTTPS: building Tails uses a caching HTTP proxy
by default and there's no way such a proxy caches data without
MitM'ing connections. However, it is of no consequence since
we verify the checksum file.
</p>
</div>

Lastly, commit:

    git commit config/chroot_local-includes/usr/share/tails/tbb-*.txt \
        -m "Upgrade Tor Browser to ${TBB_VERSION:?}." && \
    git show

<div class="caution">
<p>
If this new Tor Browser is meant to be included in a Tails
release, then that's not enough: as explained above, we need to host
the corresponding tarballs ourselves, so read on the next section.
</p>
</div>

Sync with the upstream wrapper scripts
======================================

Adapt our `config/chroot_local-includes/usr/local/bin/tor-browser`
and/or
`config/chroot_local-includes/usr/local/lib/tails-shell-library/tor-browser.sh`
for recent changes made in the Tor Browser build Git repo
(`git clone https://git.torproject.org/builders/tor-browser-build.git`):

    git log -p \
        projects/firefox/abicheck.cc \
        projects/firefox/start-firefox \
        projects/tor-browser/RelativeLink/start-tor-browser

Then apply any relevant change, e.g. to:

 - environment variables;
 - commandline options passed to the `firefox` executable;
 - required libstdc++6 version bumps; if there's been any change upstream,
   look for `abicheck` in `config/chroot_local-hooks/10-tbb` and adjust
   that hook as needed.

Self-hosted Tor Browser tarballs archive
========================================

Initial setup
-------------

First, install [[!debpts git-annex]].

Then, make sure you have an entry for `git.puppet.tails.boum.org` in
your `~/.ssh/config`. See `systems/ISO_history.mdwn` in the internal Git repo
for details.

Then, clone the metadata repository and initialize git-annex:

	git clone gitolite@git.puppet.tails.boum.org:torbrowser-archive.git && \
	cd torbrowser-archive && \
	git annex init

You now have a lot of (dangling) symlinks in place of the files that are
available in this git-annex repo.

To synchronize your local git-annex metadata with the remote, run:

	git annex sync

Set up environment variables
----------------------------

1. Make sure you still have the environment variables defined in the
   previous section set.

2. Make `TAILS_GIT_REPO` point to the main Tails Git repository
   checkout where `tbb-dist-url.txt` is being worked on, for example:

        TAILS_GIT_REPO="$HOME/tails/git"

3. Make `TBB_ARCHIVE` point to your local git annex working
   copy of our Tor Browser archive, for example:

        TBB_ARCHIVE="$HOME/tails/torbrowser-archive"

4. Make `TBB_IMPORT_BRANCH` point to the branch where you want to
   import the new Tor Browser's metadata, for example:

        TBB_IMPORT_BRANCH=feature/123456-torbrowser-42.3.4+force-all-tests

Import a new set of Tor Browser tarballs
----------------------------------------

1. Download and verify all the tarballs we need:

        DL_DIR=$(mktemp --tmpdir -d "tor-browser-${TBB_VERSION}.XXXXXXXXXX")
        CHROOT_INCLUDES="config/chroot_local-includes"
        TBB_SHA256SUMS_FILE="${CHROOT_INCLUDES:?}/usr/share/tails/tbb-sha256sums.txt"
        TBB_DIST_URL_FILE="${CHROOT_INCLUDES:?}/usr/share/tails/tbb-dist-url.txt"
        cd "${TAILS_GIT_REPO:?}" && git checkout "${TBB_IMPORT_BRANCH:?}"
        TBB_TARBALLS_BASE_URL="$(cat "${TBB_DIST_URL_FILE:?}" | sed "s,^http://,https://,")"
        current_branch=$(git -C "${TAILS_GIT_REPO:?}" branch | awk '/^\* / { print $2 }')
        for branch in "$current_branch" ; do
           git -C "${TAILS_GIT_REPO:?}" show "$branch:${TBB_SHA256SUMS_FILE:?}" \
           | while read expected_sha256 tarball; do
              (
                 cd "$DL_DIR"
                 echo "Retrieving '${TBB_TARBALLS_BASE_URL:?}/${tarball:?}'..."
                 curl --remote-name --continue-at - \
                    "${TBB_TARBALLS_BASE_URL:?}/${tarball:?}"
              )
           done
           (
              cd "${DL_DIR:?}" && \
              git -C "${TAILS_GIT_REPO:?}" show "$branch:${TBB_SHA256SUMS_FILE:?}" \
                 | sha256sum -c -
           )
        done

2. Move the tarballs into your local Git annex:

        cd "${TBB_ARCHIVE:?}" && \
        mkdir "${TBB_VERSION:?}" && cd "${TBB_VERSION:?}" && \
        git annex import --duplicate "${DL_DIR:?}/"* "${TAILS_GIT_REPO:?}/"sha256sums-*

Commit and push your changes
----------------------------

	cd "${TBB_ARCHIVE:?}" && \
	git commit -m "Add Tor Browser ${TBB_VERSION:?}." && \
	git annex sync && \
	git annex copy --to origin -- "${TBB_VERSION:?}" && \
	git annex sync

Wait for the synchronization
----------------------------

Once you've gone through these steps, a cronjob that runs every
5 minutes will download the tarballs and make them available on
<https://torbrowser-archive.tails.boum.org/?C=M&O=D>.

Wait for this to happen before you proceed with the next steps.

In the meantime, you might want to import the new Tor Browser tarballs
into your `apt-cacher-ng` local cache.

Adjust the URL in the main Git repository
-----------------------------------------

    cd "${TAILS_GIT_REPO:?}" && \
    git checkout "${TBB_IMPORT_BRANCH:?}"
    current_branch=$(git branch | awk '/^\* / { print $2 }')
    for branch in "${current_branch:?}" ; do
       git checkout "${branch:?}" && \
       echo "http://torbrowser-archive.tails.boum.org/${TBB_VERSION:?}/" > \
            config/chroot_local-includes/usr/share/tails/tbb-dist-url.txt && \
       git commit config/chroot_local-includes/usr/share/tails/tbb-dist-url.txt \
           -m "Fetch Tor Browser from our own archive." && \
       git show
    done

Clean up
--------

	cd "${TBB_ARCHIVE:?}" && \
	git annex drop -- "${TBB_VERSION:?}" && \
    git annex sync && \
    rm -rf "${DL_DIR:?}" && \
    rm "${TAILS_GIT_REPO:?}"/sha256sums-unsigned-build.txt{,.asc}
