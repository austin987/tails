We don't want to release Tails ISO's and learn 2 days later about
important security issues fixed by Debian security updates. The
following set of tools should be enough to avoid such bad timing, e.g.
by delaying a Tails release a bit to wait for a DSA to happen.

Iceweasel
=========

Mozilla updates are scheduled in advance. Searching the web for the
next (point-)release number tells you when it will be released. Add
2-3 days to this release date, and you know when a xulrunner/iceweasel
Debian security update will be ready on the mirrors.

See the [releases page](http://wiki.mozilla.org/Releases) on Mozilla
wiki.

Debian security team
====================

RequestTracker
--------------

The Debian security team uses the [Debian RT](https://rt.debian.org/)
to track some of their work. Looking at their RT queues might help us
see if something is being prepared. We, as a Debian derivative, have a
read-only access to these queues.

Security tracker
----------------

The Debian [security tracker][web]'s [SVN repository][svn] is the main
place where we can look at the Debian security team upcoming uploads
and announces. There is also a [mailing-list][] that broadcasts
changes to this repository.
