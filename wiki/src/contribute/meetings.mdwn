[[!meta title="Contributors meetings"]]

Each month a contributors meeting is organized. It currently happens
on **third day** of the month on [[#tails-dev|contribute/chat]] at
9pm CEST or CET (7pm or 8pm UTC). Everybody is welcome to attend, existing
contributors and those who want to become one.

<div class="note">

<p>As OFTC is blocking Tor lately, we temporarily gather in `#tails-dev`
on `irc.indymedia.org` instead of `irc.oftc.net`.</p>

</div>

Feel free to propose and prepare discussion topics:

  - Raise them in this thread so that others can ask details and prepare the
    discussion too.

  - Update the [[blueprint of the agenda|blueprint/monthly_meeting]].

  - Make sure that the discussion tickets that you want to treat during the
    meeting are well detailed on Redmine.

If you want to get involved but don't know yet how, please introduce
yourself during the meeting, and be sure to tell us what you are
interested in.

The meeting might not be the most adequate time and place to properly
introduce newcomers to the development process (hint:
[[contribute/low-hanging_fruit_sessions]] are more appropriate), but
at least it should be a fine place to know each others, and schedule
a better suited event.
