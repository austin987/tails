[[!meta title="Release process"]]

[[!toc levels=2]]

See the [[release_schedule]].

Requirements
============

To release Tails you'll need some packages installed:

* `tidy mktorrent transmission-cli`
* aufs DKMS module for your running kernel.
* [[!debpts squashfs-tools]] that honors `$SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`.
  Install it from our custom `devel` APT suite.
* `tails-iuk` dependencies, including suggested packages (see
  `debian/control` in the `debian` branch of its repo)
* `tails-perl5lib` dependencies (same trick as `tails-iuk` to get the
  list)

Environment
===========

Export the following environment variables to be able to copy'n'paste
the scripts snippets found on this page:

* version numbers (see [[contribute/release_schedule#versioning]]):

        export VERSION=$(dpkg-parsechangelog -SVersion)
        export TAG=$(echo "${VERSION:?}" | sed -e 's,~,-,')
        export PREVIOUS_VERSION=$(dpkg-parsechangelog --offset 1 --count 1 -SVersion)
        export PREVIOUS_TAG=$(echo "${PREVIOUS_VERSION:?}" | sed -e 's,~,-,')

* `NEXT_PLANNED_VERSION`: set to the version number of the next Tails release
  (e.g. 0.23 when releasing 0.22.1, and 1.3 when releasing 1.2)
* `NEXT_PLANNED_MAJOR_VERSION`: set to the version number of the next
  *major* Tails release
* `NEXT_PLANNED_MINOR_VERSION`: set to the version number of the next
  *minor* Tails release; if the next release is a point-release, use
  that one; otherwise, use `${VERSION}.1`
* `MAJOR_RELEASE`: set to 1 if preparing a major release, to 0 else
* `ISOS`: the directory where one stores `tails-amd64-*`
  sub-directories like the ones downloaded with BitTorrent.
* `ARTIFACTS`: the directory where build artifacts (e.g.
  the `.packages` file) land.
* `MASTER_CHECKOUT`: a checkout of the `master` branch of the main
  Tails Git repository.
* `RELEASE_BRANCH`: the name of the branch of the main Tails Git
  repository used to prepare the release (`stable` or `testing`).
* `RELEASE_CHECKOUT`: a checkout of the branch of the main Tails Git
  repository used to prepare the release (`stable` or `testing`).
* `TAILS_SIGNATURE_KEY=A490D0F4D311A4153E2BB7CADBB802B258ACD84F`
* `IUK_CHECKOUT`: a checkout of the relevant tag of the `iuk`
  Git repository.
* `PERL5LIB_CHECKOUT`: a checkout of the relevant tag of the
  `perl5lib` Git repository.
* `DIST`: either 'alpha' (for RC:s) or 'stable' (for actual releases)
* `export DEBEMAIL='tails@boum.org'`
* `export DEBFULLNAME='Tails developers'`
* `export WEBSITE_RELEASE_BRANCH="web/release-${VERSION:?}"`

Pre-freeze
==========

The [[contribute/working_together/roles/release_manager]] role
documentation has more tasks that should be done early enough.

Coordinate with Debian security updates
---------------------------------------

See [[release_process/Debian_security_updates]].

Select the right branch
=======================

What we refer to as the "release branch" (and `RELEASE_BRANCH`) should
be `testing` for major releases, and `stable` for point-releases.

<div class="caution">
Read the remainder of this document from the branch used to prepare the release!
</div>

Sanity check
============

Visit the [Jenkins RM view](https://jenkins.tails.boum.org/view/RM/)
and check that the jobs for the release branch have good enough results.

Freeze
======

Major release
-------------

If we are at freeze time for a major release:

1. Merge the `master` Git branch into `devel`:

        git checkout devel && git merge --no-ff origin/master

2. [[Merge each APT overlay suite|APT_repository/custom#workflow-merge-overlays]]
   listed in the `devel` branch's `config/APT_overlays.d/` into the `devel`
   APT suite.

3. Merge the `devel` Git branch into the `testing` one:

        git checkout testing && git merge devel

   ... and check that the resulting `config/APT_overlays.d/` in the
   `testing` branch is empty.

4. [[Hard reset|APT_repository/custom#workflow-reset]] the `testing`
   custom APT suite to the current state of the `devel` one.

5. [[Freeze|APT_repository/time-based_snapshots#freeze]] the
   time-based APT repository snapshots that shall be used
   during the freeze.

6. Make it so the time-based APT repository snapshots are kept around
   long enough, by bumping their `Valid-Until` to 10 days after the
   next major release (the one _after_ the one you're preparing)'s
   scheduled date:
   [[APT_repository/time-based_snapshots#bump-expiration-date-for-all-snapshots]]


Point-release
-------------

If we are at freeze time for a point-release:

1. Merge the `master` Git branch into `stable`:

        git checkout stable && git fetch && git merge --no-ff origin/master

2. [[Merge each APT overlay suite|APT_repository/custom#workflow-merge-overlays]]
   listed in the `stable` branch's `config/APT_overlays.d/` into the `stable`
   APT suite.

Common steps for point and major releases
-----------------------------------------

Reset the release branch's `config/base_branch`:

        echo "${RELEASE_BRANCH:?}" > config/base_branch && \
           git commit config/base_branch \
               -m "Restore ${RELEASE_BRANCH:?}'s base branch."

Bootstrap manual testing coordination:

1. Create a pad.
2. Copy the [[manual test suite|contribute/release_process/test]]
   into it.
3. Send the pad URL to the usual testers (see `manual_testers.mdwn` in
   the `internal.git` repository).

Update included files
=====================

uBlock patterns and settings file
----------------

The patterns+settings file is stored as a converted sqlite text dump in
`config/chroot_local-includes/usr/share/tails/ublock-origin/ublock0.dump`.

1. Boot Tails
2. Start the Tor Browser and open the uBlock dashboard by clicking on the uBlock icon.
3. Select the tab *3rd-party filters*
4. Click on the button *Update now* to update all used patterns
5. Close the Tor Browser
7. Copy the `.tor-browser/profile.default/extension-data/ublock0.sqlite`
   from this Tor Browser instance into the root of Tails' Git repo and
   run the following command:

        # For posterity: the general idea is to introduce \r\n as a
        # token where we have made a line break to make the dump more
        # diff-friendly (and, hence, Git-friendly). The most complex
        # expression is the one done with perl, where we employ
        # negative lookahead. What it means, is: replace single
        # occurrences of | except when followed by \\n.
        echo '.dump' | sqlite3 ublock0.sqlite | \
            grep -v "cached_asset_content://cache://compiled-" | \
            awk '!/^INSERT/; /^INSERT/ {print $0 | "sort -n"}' | \
            sed 's_\\n_\\n\r\n_g' | \
            sed 's_,_,\r\n_g' | \
            perl -p -e 's/([^|])\|((?!\||\\n).)/\1\|\r\n\2/g' | \
            sed "/^INSERT INTO \"settings\" VALUES('\(remoteBlacklists\|cached_asset_entries\)'/"'s_,_,\r\n_g' > \
            config/chroot_local-includes/usr/share/tails/ublock-origin/ublock0.dump

8. Commit:

        git commit -m 'Update uBlock Origin patterns + settings file.' \
           config/chroot_local-includes/usr/share/tails/ublock-origin/ublock0.dump \
        && rm ublock0.sqlite

Upgrade bundled binary Debian packages
--------------------------------------

Skip this section unless we are at freeze time for a major release
(i.e. we are about to prepare a release candidate).

That is: make sure the bundled binary Debian packages contain
up-to-date localization files.

For each bundled Debian package, `cd` into the package's root
directory (e.g. a checkout of the `whisperback` repository),
and then run the `import-translations` script that is in the
main Tails repository. For example:

	cd whisperback
	"${RELEASE_CHECKOUT:?}"/import-translations

If the `import-translations` script fails to import translations for
the current package, manually copy updated PO files from the
Transifex branches of `git://git.torproject.org/translation.git` (e.g.
`whisperback_completed`) instead. In this case, skip PO files for
[[translation teams that use Git|contribute/how/translate#translate]].

Add and commit.

Then check the PO files:

	"${RELEASE_CHECKOUT:?}"/submodules/jenkins-tools/slaves/check_po

Correct any displayed error, then commit the changes if any.

Then see the relevant release processes, and upload the packages to
the release branch's custom APT suite:

* [[tails-installer]]
* [[tails-greeter]]
* [[perl5lib]]
* [[persistence-setup]]
* [[tails-iuk]]
* whisperback:
  * follow [upstream release process](https://git-tails.immerda.ch/whisperback/plain/HACKING)
  * build a Debian package

Upgrade Tor Browser
-------------------

See the dedicated page: [[tor-browser]]

Upgrade Tor Browser AppArmor profile
------------------------------------

See the dedicated page: [[browser-apparmor-patch]]

Upgrade Thunderbird
---------------

See the dedicated page: [[thunderbird]]

Update PO files
---------------

Pull updated translations for languages translated in Transifex,
refresh the code PO files,
and commit the result, including new PO files:

	cd "${RELEASE_CHECKOUT:?}" && \
	./import-translations  && \
	./refresh-translations && \
	./submodules/jenkins-tools/slaves/check_po && \
	git add po && git commit -m 'Update PO files.'

If `check_po` complains:

* delete the offending PO files;
* send a note to <tails-l10n@boum.org> so that they get in touch with
  whoever can fix them.

When preparing an actual release
================================

If we're about to prepare an image for a final (non-RC) release, then
follow these instructions:

Major release
-------------

[[Merge each APT overlay suite|APT_repository/custom#workflow-merge-overlays]]
listed in the `testing` branch's `config/APT_overlays.d/` into the `testing`
custom APT suite.

Point-release
-------------

<div class="note">
For point-releases, we generally do not put any RC out, so freeze time
is the same as preparing the actual release. Hence, the following
steps have already been done above, and this section is a noop in the
general case.
</div>

[[Merge each APT overlay suite|APT_repository/custom#workflow-merge-overlays]]
listed in the `stable` branch's `config/APT_overlays.d/` into the `stable`
custom APT suite.

Update other base branches
==========================

1. Merge the release branch into `devel` following the instructions for
   [[merging base branches|APT_repository/custom#workflow-merge-main-branch]].

2. Merge `devel` into `feature/buster` following the instructions for
   [[merging base branches|APT_repository/custom#workflow-merge-main-branch]].
   Given that these two branches' APT suites have diverged a lot, and
   that `tails-merge-suite` currently happily overwrites newer
   packages in the target with older packages from the source, it's
   probably easier to just merge each individual APT overlay that was
   just merged into the release branch into `feature/buster`'s APT
   suite. Also, most of our just upgraded bundled packages
   (e.g. `tails-greeter`) may need to be rebuilt for Stretch.

3. Ensure that the release, `devel` and `feature/buster` branches
   have the expected content in `config/APT_overlays.d/`: e.g. it must
   not list any overlay APT suite that has been merged already.

4. [[Thaw|APT_repository/time-based snapshots#thaw]], on the devel
   branch, the time-based APT repository snapshots that were used
   during the freeze.

5. Push the modified branches to Git:

        git push origin                          \
           "${RELEASE_BRANCH:?}:${RELEASE_BRANCH:?}" \
           feature/buster:feature/buster       \
           devel:devel

Update more included files
==========================

Changelog
---------

Remove the placeholder entry for next release in `debian/changelog`,
and then:

	git checkout "${RELEASE_BRANCH:?}" && \
	./release ${VERSION:?} ${PREVIOUS_TAG:?}

This populates the Changelog with the Git log entries.

Then, launch an editor for the needed cleanup of the result:

	dch -e

Then, gather other useful information from:

* every custom bundled package's own Changelog (Greeter, Persistent
  Volume Assistant, etc.);
* the diff between the previous version's `.packages` file and the one
  from the to-be-released ISO; look for:
  - security fixes
  - new upstream releases of applications mentioned in [[doc/about/features]]
  - new upstream releases of other important components such as the
    Linux kernel
* the "Fix committed" section on the *Release Manager View for ${VERSION:?}*
  in Redmine.

Finally, sanity check the version and commit:

	if [ "$(dpkg-parsechangelog -SVersion)" = "${VERSION:?}" ]; then
	    git commit debian/changelog -m "Update changelog for ${VERSION:?}."
	else
	    echo 'Error: version mismatch: please compare ${VERSION:?} with the last entry in debian/changelog'
	fi

Included website
----------------

### Merge master

Merge `master` into the branch used for the release:

	git fetch origin && git merge origin/master

### version number

If preparing a RC, skip this part.

In the branch used to build the release, update the `wiki/src/inc/*` files to
match the *version number* and *date* of the new release. Set the date
at least 24 hours in the future! Between tests and mirror synchronization,
the build will not be released on the same day. Try to make sure it
matches the date of the future signature.

	RELEASE_DATE='2015-11-03'

	echo "${VERSION:?}"      > wiki/src/inc/stable_amd64_version.html
	echo -n "${RELEASE_DATE:?}" > wiki/src/inc/stable_amd64_date.html
	sed -ri "s%news/version_.*]]%news/version_${VERSION:?}]]%" wiki/src/inc/stable_amd64_release_notes.*
	${EDITOR:?} wiki/src/inc/*.html
	./build-website
	git commit wiki/src/inc/ -m "Update version and date for ${VERSION:?}."

Website translations
--------------------

Refresh the website PO files and commit the ones corresponding to
pages that were added or changed accordingly to changes coming with
the new release. This e.g. ensures that the RC call for translation
points translators to up-to-date PO files:

	./build-website && git add wiki/src && git commit -m 'Update website PO files.'
	git push origin "${RELEASE_BRANCH:?}:${RELEASE_BRANCH:?}"

Call for translation
====================

If at freeze time, send a call for translations to tails-l10n, making it clear what
Git branch the translations must be based on, and what are the
priorities. Also, add a few words to remember the translation teams
using Git that they should regularly contact Transifex translators,
as detailed on the [[documentation for
translators|contribute/how/translate]].

To get a list of changes on the website:

    git diff --stat ${PREVIOUS_VERSION:?}.. -- \
        wiki/src/'*'.{mdwn,html} \
        ':!wiki/src/blueprint*' \
        ':!wiki/src/contribute*' \
        ':!wiki/src/inc' \
        ':!wiki/src/news*' \
        ':!wiki/src/security*'

Enable OpenPGP signing
======================

### If you have an OpenPGP smart card

If you have an OpenPGP smart card (i.e. if you are one of the usual
release managers) go fetch it. Remember to only plug it when needed! A
pro tip is to never plug it unless prompted which `gpg` will do for
you. Then just unplug it as soon as the `.sig` is done.

### Otherwise: importing the signing key

This is only relevant when the master key has been reassembled,
e.g. for signing a Tails emergency release where none of the usual
release managers are available.

You should never import the Tails signing key into your own keyring,
and a good practice is to import it to a tmpfs to limit the risks that
the private key material is written to disk:

    export GNUPGHOME=$(mktemp -d)
    sudo mount -t ramfs ramfs "${GNUPGHOME:?}"
    sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) "${GNUPGHOME:?}"
    sudo chmod 0700 "${GNUPGHOME:?}"
    gpg --homedir ${HOME:?}/.gnupg --export ${TAILS_SIGNATURE_KEY:?} | gpg --import
    gpg --import path/to/private-key

Let's also ensure that strong digest algorithms are used for our
signatures, like the defaults we set in Tails:

    cp config/chroot_local-includes/etc/skel/.gnupg/gpg.conf "${GNUPGHOME:?}"

Build the almost-final image
============================

1. [[Build an ISO image|contribute/build]] from the release branch.
2. Carefully read the build logs to make sure nothing bad happened.
3. Keep at least the resulting ISO image and the manifest of needed
   packages until the end of this release process.
4. Record where the manifest of needed packages is stored:

        export PACKAGES_MANIFEST=XXX ; \
        [ -f "${PACKAGES_MANIFEST:?}" ] || echo "ERROR: PACKAGES_MANIFEST is incorrect"


Tag the release in Git
======================

	git tag -u "${TAILS_SIGNATURE_KEY:?}" \
	  -m "tagging version ${VERSION:?}" "${TAG:?}" && \
	git push origin "${TAG:?}" "${RELEASE_BRANCH:?}"

(Pushing the tag is needed so that the APT repository is updated, and
the Tails APT configuration works at build and boot time. It might be
premature, as testing might reveal critical issues, but this is
a signed tag, so it can be overridden later. Yes, there is room for
improvement here.)

XXX: From this push of a tag, the builds in Jenkins fail because we prevent it
to continue if the last debian/changelog entry has a tag. There are workarounds
we need to decide and implement.

Prepare the versioned APT suites
================================

* [[Prepare the versioned APT suite in our custom APT repository|APT_repository/custom#workflow-post-tag]].

* Prepare tagged snapshots of upstream APT repositories:

          ./bin/tag-apt-snapshots "${PACKAGES_MANIFEST:?}" "${TAG:?}"

  Note:

  - This command can take a while (about a dozen minutes).
  - It's expected that the packages that were pulled from our
    [[custom APT repository|APT_repository/custom]] are
    listed under "some packages were not found anywhere" (because we
    are currently not using time-based snapshots for our custom APT
    repository). However, _no other package should be on that list_.
    Now, we have a "safety" net, in case you don't notice such a problem: if
    other packages are missing, the next build (that will use the
    newly created partial, tagged APT repository) will fail.

Build images
============

Sanity check
------------

Verify that the Tor Browser release used in Tails still is the most
recent. Also look if there's a new `-buildX` tag for the targeted
Tor Browser version in these Git repositories:

* <https://gitweb.torproject.org/builders/tor-browser-bundle.git>
* <https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor-browser.git>

A new tag may indicate that a new Tor Browser release is imminent.

Better catch this before people spend time doing manual tests.

SquashFS file order
-------------------

1. Burn the almost final ISO image to a DVD.
1. Boot this DVD **on bare metal**.
1. Add `profile` to the kernel command-line.
1. Login.
1. Wait for the "Tor is ready" notification.
1. Start the web browser.
1. A few minutes later, once the `boot-profile` process has been
   killed, retrieve the new sort file from `/var/log/boot-profile`.
1. Copy the new sort file to `config/binary_rootfs/squashfs.sort`.
1. Cleanup a bit:
   - remove `var/log/live/config.pipe`: otherwise the boot is broken
     or super-slow
   - remove the bits about `kill-boot-profile` at the end: they're
     only useful when profiling the boot
1. Inspect the Git diff (including diff stat), apply common sense.
   The following command is also helpful but requires that you save a
   copy of the old sort file into `/tmp/squashfs.sort.old`:

        diff -NaurB \
            <( cut -d' ' -f1 /tmp/squashfs.sort.old | sort ) \
            <( cut -d' ' -f1 config/binary_rootfs/squashfs.sort | sort ) \
            | less

1. `git commit -m 'Updating SquashFS sort file' config/binary_rootfs/squashfs.sort`

Build the final image
---------------------

Then all included files should be up-to-date and the versioned APT
suite should be ready, so it is time to:

1. Mark the version as "released" in the changelog:

        dch --release --no-force-save-on-release --maintmaint
        git commit -m "Mark Tails ${VERSION:?} as released." debian/changelog

1. Export `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`:

        export SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH=$(date --utc --date="$(dpkg-parsechangelog --show-field=Date)" '+%s')

1. tag the release *again*, with all included files in:

        git tag -f -u "${TAILS_SIGNATURE_KEY:?}" \
                -m "tagging version ${VERSION:?}" "${TAG:?}" && \
        git push origin "${RELEASE_BRANCH:?}" && \
        git push --force origin "${TAG:?}"

   Note: for Jenkins to build the release you must push the release
   branch with its tip tagged. I.e. if you deviate from the above
   commands by e.g. committing a commit in between `git tag` and the
   first `git push` then Jenkins won't build from the tag -- please
   avoid that!

1. build the final image!

1. compare the new build manifest with the one from the previous,
   almost final build; they should be identical, except that the
   `debian-security` serial might be higher. To ensure we publish
   the final build's `.build-manifest`, please run:

        export PACKAGES_MANIFEST="${ARTIFACTS:?}/tails-amd64-${VERSION:?}.iso.build-manifest"


1. <a id="reproducibility-sanity-check-iso"></a>
   Let's sanity check that Jenkins reproduced your image.

   Visit the URL printed by this command:

       echo "https://jenkins.tails.boum.org/job/build_Tails_ISO_${RELEASE_BRANCH}/"

   Find the job (probably the last one)
   and make sure the image built by Jenkins:

   - was built from the correct Git commit
   - has the same file size as the image you built
   - has the same hash (in the `.shasum` file) as the image you built

   Then:

   - If all hashes match: yay, we're good to go!

   - If there is a hash mismatch for the image: ouch! Now we are in a
     tricky situation: on the one hand it seems like a poor idea to
     block users from benefiting from this release's security updates,
     but on the other hand the failure might imply that something
     nefarious is going on. At this stage, no matter what, immediately
     fetch Jenkins' image, compare it with your, and try to rule out
     build system compromise:

          sudo diffoscope \
              --text diffoscope.txt \
              --html diffoscope.html \
              --max-report-size 262144000 \
              --max-diff-block-lines 10000 \
              --max-diff-input-lines 10000000 \
                  path/to/your/tails-amd64-${VERSION:?}.iso \
                  path/to/jenkins/tails-amd64-${VERSION:?}.iso

     Then carefully investigate the `diffoscope` report:

       - If you cannot rule out that the difference is harmful: let's take
         a step back; we might be compromised, so we are in no position to
         release. Halt the release, involve the rest of `tails@`, and then
         try to re-establish trust in all build machines and infra
         involved, etc. Have fun!

       - Otherwise, if the change is definitely harmless:

         * If the source of non-determinism is identified quickly and
           is easy and fast to fix, *and* the QA of the current image
           has not gone very far (so at least that time is not wasted),
           then you should consider abandoning the current version, and
           immediately start preparing an emergency release with:

           - the reproducibility fix,
           - a new changelog entry,
           - adjustments to the release notes so they are re-purposed for
             this emergency release (the abandoned release gets none, since
             it effectively never will be released publicly).

         * Otherwise, if the fix looks time-consuming or difficult,
           let's release anyway. But let's add a known issue about
           "This Tails release does not build reproducibility" to the
           release notes, linking to the ticket where
           the nature of the reproducibility failure is clearly
           described.

1. check out a new branch:

   If preparing anything but a final release (e.g. an alpha, beta
   or RC):

        git checkout -b "${WEBSITE_RELEASE_BRANCH:?}" origin/master && \
        git push -u origin "${WEBSITE_RELEASE_BRANCH:?}"

   Else, if preparing a final release:

        git checkout -b "${WEBSITE_RELEASE_BRANCH:?}" "${TAG:?}" && \
        git push -u origin "${WEBSITE_RELEASE_BRANCH:?}"

   (as soon as a new commit is created on `$RELEASE_BRANCH`, its ISO
   build will start failing until a new changelog entry is created,
   which we don't want to do on `$RELEASE_BRANCH` before it's merged
   into `master` at release time)

Generate the OpenPGP signatures and Torrents
============================================

First, create a directory with a suitable name and go there:

	mkdir "${ISOS:?}/tails-amd64-${VERSION:?}" && \
	cd "${ISOS:?}/tails-amd64-${VERSION:?}"

Second, move the built image to this brand new directory:

	mv "${ARTIFACTS:?}/tails-amd64-${VERSION:?}.iso" \
	   "${ISOS:?}/tails-amd64-${VERSION:?}/"

Third, generate detached OpenPGP signatures for the image to be
published, in the same directory as the image and with a `.sig`
extension; e.g.

	gpg --armor --default-key "${TAILS_SIGNATURE_KEY:?}" --detach-sign *.iso
	rename 's,\.asc$,.sig,' *.asc

Fourth, go up to the parent directory, create a `.torrent` file and
check the generated `.torrent` files metainfo:

	cd .. && \
	mktorrent \
	  -a 'udp://tracker.torrent.eu.org:451' \
	  -a 'udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969'   \
	  "tails-amd64-${VERSION:?}" && \
	transmission-show tails-amd64-${VERSION:?}.torrent

Lastly, let's set some variables to be used later:

    ISO_PATH="${ISOS:?}/tails-amd64-${VERSION:?}/tails-amd64-${VERSION:?}.iso"
    ISO_SHA256SUM="$(sha256sum "${ISO_PATH:?}" | cut -f 1 -d ' ' | tr -d '\n')"
    ISO_SIZE_IN_BYTES="$(stat -c %s "${ISO_PATH:?}")"

Prepare incremental upgrades
============================

Build the Incremental Upgrade Kits
----------------------------------

Incremental upgrades may be skipped if the delta is too big (like when
migrating to a new Debian release) or if there are changes outside of
the scope for IUKs (like partition table changes). Use common sense!

Use `tails-create-iuk` to build the following IUKs:

* From the two previous *planned* releases, and any emergency releases
  in between and after. This should be, more or less, all releases for
  the last 12 weeks (although irregularities in Firefox release
  schedule may add or remove a few weeks).

* From the last RC for the version being released, e.g. 1.0~rc1 to
  1.0. This should be done even if there was no IUK generated from the
  previous stable release since it is a good way to test the iuk code
  that'll be used for the incremental upgrade paths to the
  next version.

Include each such version in a white-space separated list called
`IUK_SOURCE_VERSIONS`, (e.g. `IUK_SOURCE_VERSIONS="2.8 2.9 2.9.1 2.10~rc1"`)
and run the following:

    for source_version in ${IUK_SOURCE_VERSIONS}; do
        if [ "$(dpkg-query --showformat '${Version}\n' --show squashfs-tools)" != 1:4.3-3.0tails4 ]; then
            echo 'ERROR! Your squashfs-tools probably does not honor SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH so any generated IUKs will *not* be reproducible!'
            break
        fi
        sudo su -c "cd ${IUK_CHECKOUT:?} && \
          SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH=$SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH \
          LC_ALL=C \
          PERL5LIB=\"${PERL5LIB_CHECKOUT:?}/lib\" \
            ./bin/tails-create-iuk \
               --squashfs-diff-name \"${VERSION:?}.squashfs\"           \
               --old-iso \"${ISOS:?}/tails-amd64-${source_version:?}/tails-amd64-${source_version:?}.iso\" \
               --new-iso \"${ISOS:?}/tails-amd64-${VERSION:?}/tails-amd64-${VERSION:?}.iso\"          \
               --outfile \"${ISOS:?}/Tails_amd64_${source_version:?}_to_${VERSION:?}.iuk\""
    done

Note that developer tools for creating IUK and upgrade-description
files were only tested on Debian sid. It should hopefully work well on
Jessie too.

<a id="reproducibility-sanity-check-iuk"></a>

Note that we do not yet build IUKs on Jenkins, otherwise here would be
a great point to compare its IUKs with yours.

<a id="prepare-upgrade-description-files"></a>

Prepare upgrade-description files
---------------------------------

1. Prepare upgrade-description files (see the [[upgrade-description
   files
   specification|contribute/design/incremental_upgrades#upgrade-description-files]]
   for details). The idea is to:

   * update (create if needed) an upgrade-description file for every
     *previous* supported release (e.g. N~rc1, N-1, N-1~rc2) that replaces
     all existing upgrade paths with the path to the version being
     released;
   * create a new upgrade-description for the version being released
     and for the next one, that expresses that *no* upgrade is
     available for these ones yet.

   This is what `tails-iuk-generate-upgrade-description-files` tool
   does:

        ( cd ${IUK_CHECKOUT:?} && \
        ./bin/tails-iuk-generate-upgrade-description-files \
            --build-target amd64 \
            --version "${VERSION:?}" \
            --next-version "${NEXT_PLANNED_MAJOR_VERSION:?}" \
            --next-version "${NEXT_PLANNED_MAJOR_VERSION:?}~rc1" \
            --next-version "${NEXT_PLANNED_MINOR_VERSION:?}" \
            --next-version "${VERSION:?}.1" \
            --iso "${ISO_PATH:?}" \
            --previous-version "${PREVIOUS_VERSION:?}" \
            --previous-version "${VERSION:?}~rc1" \
            --iuks "${ISOS:?}" \
            --release-checkout "${RELEASE_CHECKOUT:?}" \
            --major-release "${MAJOR_RELEASE:?}" \
       )

   Note:
   * The `--iuks` argument must point to the directory where the IUKs
     generated at the previous step are stored.
   * At least the last stable release and the previous release
     candidates for the version being released must be passed to
     `--previous-version`.
   * Older versions for which there is no incremental upgrade path to
     the new release must be passed with `--previous-version`, so that
     users who skipped a release or two are informed of the new one.
     Note that multi-steps incremental upgrade paths are valid and
     supported: e.g. when releasing 1.1.2, 1.1 users should still be
     able to incrementally upgrade to 1.1.1, and in turn to 1.1.2; to
     make this work, one must _not_ pass `--previous-version 1.1`,
     that would remove the existing incremental upgrade path from 1.1
     to 1.1.1.
   * If preparing anything but a final release (e.g. an alpha, beta
     or RC), add `--channel alpha`
   * If preparing anything but a final release (e.g. an alpha, beta
     or RC), drop all `--next-version`
     arguments, and instead pass (**untested!**)
     `--next-version $(echo ${VERSION:?} | sed -e 's,~rc.*$,,')`
   * If preparing a point-release, pass neither
     `--next-version "${VERSION:?}.1"`,
     nor `--next-version "${VERSION:?}.1~rc1"`

1. Create an armoured detached signature for each created or modified
   upgrade-description file.

        find "${RELEASE_CHECKOUT:?}/wiki/src/upgrade/" \
           -type f -name upgrades.yml | \
           while read udf; do
               if [ -n "$(git status --porcelain "${udf:?}")" ]; then
                   for x in 1 2 3; do
                       gpg -u "${TAILS_SIGNATURE_KEY:?}" --armor \
                           --detach-sign "${udf:?}" \
                       && break
                   done
                   mv --force "${udf:?}.asc" "${udf:?}.pgp"
                   ( \
                     cd ${IUK_CHECKOUT:?} && \
                     ./bin/tails-iuk-check-upgrade-description-file "${udf:?}" \
                   ) || break
               fi
           done

1. Add and commit the upgrade-description files and their detached
   signatures to the Git branch used to prepare the release
   (`$WEBSITE_RELEASE_BRANCH`):

        ( \
          cd "${RELEASE_CHECKOUT:?}" && git add wiki/src/upgrade && \
          git commit -m "Update upgrade-description files." && \
          git push origin ${WEBSITE_RELEASE_BRANCH:?} \
        )

1. If preparing anything but a final release (e.g. an alpha, beta
   or RC), copy the generated or updated files to
   `${MASTER_CHECKOUT:?}`, replace `channel: alpha` with `channel:
   test`, sign them, commit and push.

1. Else, if preparing a final release, copy the generated UDF for the previous
   release to the *test* channel in `$MASTER_CHECKOUT`, modify its content
   accordingly, sign it, commit and push:

        ( \
          cd ${MASTER_CHECKOUT:?} && \
          git fetch && \
          for old_version in ${IUK_SOURCE_VERSIONS:?}; do
            stable_udf="wiki/src/upgrade/v1/Tails/${old_version:?}/amd64/stable/upgrades.yml" && \
            test_udf="wiki/src/upgrade/v1/Tails/${old_version:?}/amd64/test/upgrades.yml" && \
            mkdir -p "$(dirname "$test_udf")" && \
            git show origin/${WEBSITE_RELEASE_BRANCH:?}:${stable_udf:?} \
              | sed -e 's/channel: stable/channel: test/' > ${test_udf:?} && \
            gpg -u "${TAILS_SIGNATURE_KEY:?}" --armor --detach-sign ${test_udf:?} && \
            mv ${test_udf:?}.asc ${test_udf:?}.pgp && \
            git add ${test_udf:?}* ; \
          done && \
          git commit -m "Add incremental upgrades on the test channel for Tails ${VERSION:?}" && \
          git push origin master:master \
        )


Prepare the ISO description file for *Tails Verification*
---------------------------------------------------------

If preparing a RC, skip this part.

Update the ISO description file (IDF) used by the browser extension:

    cat > "${RELEASE_CHECKOUT:?}"/wiki/src/install/v1/Tails/amd64/stable/latest.yml <<EOF
    ---
    build-target: amd64
    channel: stable
    product-name: Tails
    version: '${VERSION:?}'
    target-files:
    - sha256: ${ISO_SHA256SUM}
      size: ${ISO_SIZE_IN_BYTES:?}
      url: http://dl.amnesia.boum.org/tails/stable/tails-amd64-${VERSION:?}/tails-amd64-${VERSION:?}.iso
    EOF
    ( cd "${RELEASE_CHECKOUT:?}" && \
      git add wiki/src/install/v1/Tails/amd64/stable/latest.yml && \
      git commit -m "Update IDF file for Tails Verification." )

Done with OpenPGP signing
=========================

By now you are done with Tails signing key, so please make sure it is
not usable by your system any more.

<div class="note">

Beware! If your have to plug your OpenPGP smart card or reassemble the
key again after this point it invalidates <i>everything</i> done for
the [[reproduction of this release|test#reproducibility-final-check]]
so it has to be started from the beginning:

* the original text is restored on the pad, and
* some tester follows it from scratch, and
* the Trusted Reproducer follows awaits the new input from said tester
  and then starts from scratch.

So please try to avoid this!

</div>

Upload images
=============

Sanity check
------------

Verify once more that the Tor Browser we ship is still the most recent (see
above).

<a id="publish-iuk"></a>

Publish the ISO and IUK over HTTP
---------------------------------

Upload the IUKs to the primary rsync mirror:

    for source_version in ${IUK_SOURCE_VERSIONS}; do
       rsync --partial --inplace --progress -v \
          "${ISOS:?}/Tails_amd64_${source_version:?}_to_${VERSION:?}.iuk" \
          rsync.lizard:
    done

Upload the ISO signature to the primary rsync mirror:

    scp "${ISO_PATH:?}.sig" rsync.lizard:

Pick a build from `$RELEASE_BRANCH` that produced an ISO identical to
the one you've built locally (`XXX` must be the job ID, i.e.
an integer):

    MATCHING_JENKINS_BUILD_ID=XXX

Copy the ISO to the primary rsync mirror and verify the signature:

    cat "${RELEASE_CHECKOUT:?}/wiki/src/tails-signing.key" \
       | ssh rsync.lizard gpg --import
    ssh rsync.lizard << EOF
       wget \
          "https://nightly.tails.boum.org/build_Tails_ISO_${RELEASE_BRANCH:?}/builds/${MATCHING_JENKINS_BUILD_ID:?}/archive/build-artifacts/tails-amd64-${VERSION:?}.iso" && \
       gpg --verify tails-amd64-${VERSION:?}.iso{.sig,}
    EOF

Move files in place with proper ownership and permissions:

    ssh rsync.lizard << EOF
      sudo install -o root -g rsync_tails -m 0755 -d \
         /srv/rsync/tails/tails/${DIST:?}/tails-amd64-${VERSION:?} && \
      sudo chown root:rsync_tails \
         tails-amd64-${VERSION:?}.iso* \
         Tails_amd64_*_to_${VERSION:?}.iuk && \
      sudo chmod u=rwX,go=rX \
         tails-amd64-${VERSION:?}.iso* \
         Tails_amd64_*_to_${VERSION:?}.iuk && \
      sudo mv tails-amd64-${VERSION:?}.iso* \
              /srv/rsync/tails/tails/${DIST:?}/tails-amd64-${VERSION:?} && \
      sudo mv Tails_amd64_*_to_${VERSION:?}.iuk \
              /srv/rsync/tails/tails/${DIST:?}/iuk/
    EOF

Update the time in `project/trace` file on the primary rsync mirror
and on the live wiki (even for a release candidate):

	TRACE_TIME=$(date +%s) &&
	echo ${TRACE_TIME:?} | ssh rsync.lizard "cat > /srv/rsync/tails/tails/project/trace" && \
	[ -n "${MASTER_CHECKOUT:?}" ] && \
	echo ${TRACE_TIME:?} > "${MASTER_CHECKOUT:?}/wiki/src/inc/trace" &&
	(
	   cd "${MASTER_CHECKOUT:?}" && \
	   git commit wiki/src/inc/trace \
	      -m "Updating trace file after uploading ${VERSION:?}." && \
	   git push origin master
	)


## Announce, seed and test the Torrents

    cat "${RELEASE_CHECKOUT:?}/wiki/src/tails-signing.key" \
       | ssh bittorrent.lizard gpg --import
    scp \
       "${ISOS:?}/tails-amd64-${VERSION:?}.torrent" \
       "${ISO_PATH:?}.sig" \
       bittorrent.lizard: && \
    ssh bittorrent.lizard << EOF
       mkdir --mode 0755 "tails-amd64-${VERSION:?}" && \
       mv "tails-amd64-${VERSION:?}.iso.sig" \
          "tails-amd64-${VERSION:?}/" && \
       cd "tails-amd64-${VERSION:?}" && \
       wget \
          "https://nightly.tails.boum.org/build_Tails_ISO_${RELEASE_BRANCH:?}/builds/${MATCHING_JENKINS_BUILD_ID:?}/archive/build-artifacts/tails-amd64-${VERSION:?}.iso" && \
       gpg --verify tails-amd64-${VERSION:?}.iso{.sig,} && \
       cd && \
       chgrp -R debian-transmission "tails-amd64-${VERSION:?}" && \
       chmod -R go+rX,g+w "tails-amd64-${VERSION:?}" && \
       mv \
          "tails-amd64-${VERSION:?}" \
          /var/lib/transmission-daemon/downloads/ && \
       transmission-remote --add tails-amd64-${VERSION:?}.torrent \
                           --find /var/lib/transmission-daemon/downloads/
    EOF

Test that you can start downloading the ISO with a BitTorrent client.

ISO history
-----------

Push the released ISO to our Tails ISO history git-annex repo, so that
our isotesters can fetch it from there for their testing. How to do so
is described in our internal Git repo.

Testing
=======

1. Using `check-mirrors`, choose a fast mirror that already has the
   tentative ISO. E.g. <https://mirrors.kernel.org/tails/> or
   <https://mirrors.wikimedia.org/tails/> are reliable and have plenty
   of bandwidth.

        ./check-mirrors.rb --allow-multiple --channel ${DIST:?} \
            --ip $(dig +short mirrors.kernel.org | tail -n1) \
            tails-amd64-${VERSION:?}

1. Email <tails-testers@boum.org> to ask them to test the tentative
   ISO, pointing them to the up-to-date mirror you've found previously.
1. Email <tails@boum.org> and potential contributors (see
   `manual_testers.mdwn` in the internal Git repository) that tests
   may start:
   - make sure the Trusted Verifier is in the list of recipients
   - point them to the up-to-date mirror you've found previously
   - make it clear what's the deadline
   - make it clear where and how you expect to get feedback
   - attach the Torrent
   - attach the `.packages` file
1. Make sure someone is committed to run the automated test suite.
1. Make sure that enough people are here to run the tests, that they
   report their results in due time, and that they make it clear when
   they're leaving for good.
1. Fill the holes and make sure that the manual test suite is done in
   due time.
1. Triage test results, reproduce bugs as needed, decide what the next
   step is and make sure it happens: add to known issues? file ticket?
   release blocker?

Update the website and Git repository
=====================================

What follows in this section happens on the `$WEBSITE_RELEASE_BRANCH`
branch in `${RELEASE_CHECKOUT:?}`.

If preparing a final release
----------------------------

Skip this part if preparing a RC.

Rename the `.packages` file to remove the `.iso` and build date parts
of its name:

	mv "${ARTIFACTS:?}"/tails-amd64-"${VERSION:?}".iso.packages \
	   "${ARTIFACTS:?}/tails-amd64-${VERSION:?}.packages"

Rename the manifest of needed packages as well:

	mv "${PACKAGES_MANIFEST:?}" \
	   "${ARTIFACTS:?}/tails-amd64-${VERSION:?}.build-manifest"

Copy the `.iso.sig`, `.build-manifest`, `.packages`, `.torrent` and
`.torrent.sig` files into the website repository:

	cp "${ISO_PATH:?}.sig" \
	   "${ARTIFACTS:?}/tails-amd64-${VERSION:?}.build-manifest" \
	   "${ARTIFACTS:?}/tails-amd64-${VERSION:?}.packages" \
	   "${ISOS:?}/tails-amd64-${VERSION:?}.torrent" \
	   "${RELEASE_CHECKOUT:?}/wiki/src/torrents/files/"

Remove from `wiki/src/torrents/files/` any remaining file from the
previous release (including any RC).

Update the size of the ISO image in `inc/*`:

        LC_NUMERIC=C ls -l -h ${ISO_PATH:?} | \
          cut -f 5 -d ' ' | sed -r 's/(.+)([MG])/\1 \2B/' \
          > "${RELEASE_CHECKOUT:?}/wiki/src/inc/stable_amd64_iso_size.html"

Generate the expected signature verification output:

      LANG=C TZ=UTC gpg --no-options --keyid-format 0xlong --verify "${ISO_PATH:?}.sig" "${ISO_PATH:?}" 2>&1 | \
      sed 's/ /\&nbsp;/g;s/</\&lt;/;s/>/\&gt;/;s/$/<br\/>/g' > \
      "${RELEASE_CHECKOUT:?}/wiki/src/inc/stable_amd64_gpg_signature_output.html"

Ensure our [[contribute/working_together/roles/technical_writer]] has
[[written|contribute/how/documentation/release_notes]] the
announcement for the release in `wiki/src/news/version_${TAG:?}.mdwn`.

Write an announcement listing the security bugs affecting the previous
version in
`wiki/src/security/Numerous_security_holes_in_${PREVIOUS_VERSION:?}.mdwn`
in order to let the users of the old versions
know that they have to upgrade. Date it a few days before the ISO
image to be released was *built*. Including:

- if we are not shipping Linux from Debian stable, the list of
  CVE fixed in Linux since the one shipped in the previous release of
  Tails; you can find them in the relevant changelog e.g.:
  * <http://metadata.ftp-master.debian.org/changelogs/main/l/linux/unstable_changelog>
  * <http://metadata.ftp-master.debian.org/changelogs/main/l/linux/testing_changelog>
  * <http://metadata.ftp-master.debian.org/changelogs/main/l/linux/stretch-backports_changelog>
- the list of DSA fixed in packages we ship since those that were in
  the previous release of Tails: <https://www.debian.org/security/#DSAS>
- the list of BSA fixed in packages we ship since those that were in
  the previous release of Tails:
  <https://lists.debian.org/debian-backports-announce/>
- the list of MFSA fixed by the Tor Browser update:
  <https://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/>

If preparing a release candidate
--------------------------------

Skip this part if preparing a final release.

Copy the `.iso.sig` file into the website repository:

	cp "${ISO_PATH:?}.sig" \
	   "${ISOS:?}/tails-amd64-${VERSION:?}.torrent" \
	      "${MASTER_CHECKOUT:?}/wiki/src/torrents/files/"

Write the announcement for the release in
`${MASTER_CHECKOUT:?}/wiki/src/news/test_${TAG:?}.mdwn`, including:

- Update the `meta title` directive.
- Update the `meta date` directive.
- Document important config changes that persistence users have to do
  themselves (e.g. the Pidgin proxy settings change in
  [[!tails_gitweb_commit 9925321]] breaks all existing persistent
  profiles).
- Document known issues.
- This snippet can help to convert the copied changelog's ticket
  references to links:

      sed -i 's@#\([0-9]\{4,5\}\)@[[!tails_ticket \1]]@g' \
          wiki/src/news/test_${TAG:?}.mdwn

In any case
-----------

If preparing a final release, what follows happens on the
`$WEBSITE_RELEASE_BRANCH` in `$RELEASE_CHECKOUT`. Else, it happens in
`$MASTER_CHECKOUT`.

Generate PO files for the announcements with `./build-website`.

Then, send them to <tails-l10n@boum.org> so that they get translated
shortly, perhaps even soon enough to integrate them before pushing the
release out officially.

Then, record the last commit before putting the release out for real:

	git add wiki/src && \
	git commit -m "releasing version ${VERSION:?}"

Go wild!
========

Wait for the HTTP mirrors to catch up
-------------------------------------

Test downloading the ISO and IUK over HTTP.

Make sure every active mirror in the pool has the new version:

	./check-mirrors.rb --channel ${DIST:?} --allow-multiple --fast \
        tails-amd64-${VERSION:?}

Ask <tails-mirrors@boum.org> to drop those that are lagging behind and
notify their administrators.

Sanity checks
-------------

* Check the outcome of the "Testing" section above.
* Wait for the Mozilla security advisory
  [to be published](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/).
* Verify once more that the Tor Browser we ship is still the most recent (see
  above).

Push
----

### Git

If preparing an actual release, push the last commits to our Git
repository and put `master` in the following state:

    ( cd "${RELEASE_CHECKOUT:?}" && \
      git push origin \
          "${WEBSITE_RELEASE_BRANCH:?}:${WEBSITE_RELEASE_BRANCH:?}" \
          devel:devel \
    ) && \
    ( cd "${MASTER_CHECKOUT:?}" && \
      git fetch && \
      git merge "origin/${WEBSITE_RELEASE_BRANCH:?}" \
    )

Then (or if you preparing a release candidate) ensure that `master`
has `stable` as its base branch:

    ( cd "${MASTER_CHECKOUT:?}" && \
      echo "stable" > config/base_branch && \
      git commit config/base_branch \
          -m "Restore master's base branch." \
    )

Finally, push the `master` branch to make the changes go live on our
website:

    ( cd "${MASTER_CHECKOUT:?}" && \
      git push origin master:master \
    )

The release is now public! Woo!

Check translation are correct
-----------------------------

Once the push is over and the live website is build, check that each
`news/version_${VERSION}` HTML and RSS pages looks OK in all supported
languages.

Bug tracker
-----------

Skip this part if preparing a release candidate.

Mark all issues fixed in this release as `Status: Resolved` in our bug
tracker. For a list of candidates, see:

* the [issues in *Fix committed*
  status](https://labs.riseup.net/code/projects/tails/issues?query_id=111);
* the "Fix committed" section on the *Release Manager View for ${VERSION:?}*
  in Redmine.

Then, mark the just-released Redmine milestone as done: go to the
target version page, click *Edit*, and set *Status* to *Closed*.

### Tickets linked from the website

Go through the tickets linked from the documentation and support sections of the
website and point documentation writers to the tickets that might be resolved in

Remember that ticket expressions, e.g. `[[!tails_ticket 1234]]`, can
span several lines, so finding the ones reported by the above code
*might* be harder than `git grep "tails_ticket 1234"`.

Twitter
-------

Check in the comments of the ticket for the release notes if the
technical writers have prepared a tweet. Otherwise tweet a simple link
to the release notes:

Tor blog
--------

XXX: move most of this to the list of things that can be done while
waiting for manual test results, replace "Save and publish" there with
"Save and keep unpublished", and keep only the "Save and publish" step
here (+ adjust *Authoring Information* → *Authored on* since the date
of the draft creation won't be correct). I didn't do this yet as it
would conflict with the changes I've done for [[!tails_ticket 12629]]
in painful ways.

We announce *major* releases on the Tor blog:

Prepare for the next release
============================

XXX: adapt / fork for release candidates. In the meantime, read all
this, and skip what does not make sense for a RC.

1. If you just released a new stable release, remove the previous
   stable release on the mirrors.
1. Remove any remaining RC for the just-published release from
   the mirrors.
1. Remove IUKs that are more than 6 months old from
   `/{stable,alpha}/iuk` on the rsync server:
   - first check that it's not going to remove anything we want to keep:

         ssh rsync.lizard /bin/sh -c \
             \"find /srv/rsync/tails/tails/alpha  \
                    /srv/rsync/tails/tails/stable \
                    -type f -name '*.iuk' -mtime '+183' \
                    -not -name '*~test_*~test.iuk' -ls \
             \"

   - then actually delete the files:

         ssh rsync.lizard /bin/sh -c \
             \"find /srv/rsync/tails/tails/alpha  \
                    /srv/rsync/tails/tails/stable \
                    -type f -name '*.iuk' -mtime '+183' \
                    -not -name '*~test_*~test.iuk' -delete \
             \"

1. Check how much space our mirrors need:

        ssh rsync.lizard du -sh /srv/rsync/tails

   Compare it to the minimum disk space we ask of our mirror operators
   (30 GiB) and determine if any further action is needed to either
   reduce our usage by deleting stuff, or asking them to give us more
   space.
1. Delete Git branches that were merged:

        cd "${MASTER_CHECKOUT:?}" && \
        git checkout master && \
        git fetch && \
        git submodule update && \
        bare_repo=$(mktemp -d)
        git clone --bare --reference "${MASTER_CHECKOUT:?}" \
           boum_org_amnesia@webmasters.boum.org:wiki.git \
           "${bare_repo:?}" && \
        PYTHONPATH=lib/python3 ./bin/delete-merged-git-branches \
           --repo "${bare_repo:?}" && \
        rm -rf "${bare_repo:?}"

1. Remove all old versions in `wiki/src/upgrade/v1/Tails` and
   `debian/changelog` that were never released. Explanation: the
   post-release APT repository steps from the previous stable release
   will usually have had us prepare for an emergency release that was
   never made.
1. [[Thaw the packages that were granted freeze exceptions|APT_repository/time-based snapshots#freeze-exceptions-post-release]].
1. Pull `master` back and merge it into `stable`, and in turn into
   `devel`
1. [[Thaw|APT_repository/time-based snapshots#thaw]], on the devel
   branch, the time-based APT repository snapshots that were used
   during the freeze. This should generally be a no-op but if there
   was some hiccup earlier it could be needed.
1. Follow the
   [[post-release|APT_repository/custom#workflow-post-release]]
   custom APT repository documentation. Make sure there are upgrade-description
   files for any new versions that were added.
1. Verify that the snapshots used in the release branch are ok,
   e.g. they use the correct snapshots, and they were bumped
   appropriately (they should expire after the major release _after_
   the one you're preparing). Look carefully at the output of this command:

        git checkout "${RELEASE_BRANCH:?}" && \
        for dir in config/APT_snapshots.d vagrant/definitions/tails-builder/config/APT_snapshots.d; do
        (
            echo "${dir:?}:"
            cd "${dir:?}" && \
            for ARCHIVE in * ; do
                SERIAL="$(cat ${ARCHIVE:?}/serial)"
                if [ "${SERIAL:?}" = 'latest' ]; then
                    EXPIRY='never'
                    if [ "${ARCHIVE:?}" != 'debian-security' ]; then
                        echo "Warning: origin '${ARCHIVE:?}' is using the 'latest' snapshot, which is unexpected" >&2
                    fi
                else
                    if [ "${ARCHIVE:?}" = 'debian-security' ]; then
                        DIST='stretch/updates'
                    else
                        DIST='stable'
                   fi
                   EXPIRY="$(curl --silent "http://time-based.snapshots.deb.tails.boum.org/${ARCHIVE:?}/dists/${DIST:?}/snapshots/${SERIAL:?}/Release" | sed -n 's/^Valid-Until:\s\+\(.*\)$/\1/p')"
                fi
                echo "* Archive '${ARCHIVE:?}' uses snapshot '${SERIAL:?}' which expires on: ${EXPIRY:?}"
            done
            echo ---
        )
        done

1. Push the resulting branches.
1. Make sure Jenkins manages to build all updated major branches:
   <https://jenkins.tails.boum.org/>.
1. Make sure you pushed all changes in every of our Git repo (including our
   Debian packages ones).
1. Delete the _Release Manager View for ${VERSION_:?}_ Redmine custom query.
1. Ensure the next two releases have their own _Release Manager View_.
1. On the [[!tails_roadmap]], update the *Due date* for the *Holes
   in the Roof* so that this section appears after the next release.
1. If you are the release manager for the next release too, look at the
   tasks that must be done at the beginning of your shift in the
   [[release manager role page|contribute/working_together/roles/release_manager]].
   Otherwise, kindly remind the next release manager about this :)
