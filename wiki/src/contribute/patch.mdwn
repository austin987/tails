To avoid duplicating work without coordination, here's a queue of
suggested patches.

If you post a patch to the [[todo]] or [[bugs]] list, or elsewhere,
once it's ready to be applied, add a 'patch' tag so it will show up here.

If your patch is non-trivial and might need several iterations to get
right, please consider publishing a [[contribute/git]] branch.

[[!inline pages="(todo/* or bugs/*) and link(patch)
and !link(bugs/done) and !link(todo/done) and !tagged(todo/done)
and !tagged(pending) and !link(todo/pending) and !link(bugs/pending)
and !*/Discussion" rootpage="todo" archive="yes"]]
