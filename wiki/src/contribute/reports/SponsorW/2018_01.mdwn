This report covers the activity of Tails in January 2018.

Everything in this report is public.

# A. VeraCrypt support in GNOME

## A.4 Add VeraCrypt support to udisks

We added support  for unlocking hidden volumes and using keyfiles to libblockdev ([[!tails_ticket 15216]]) and udisks ([[!tails_ticket 15215]]). We also fixed some bugs and improved the code style of our udisks patches ([[!tails_ticket 15215]]).

## A.6 Add VeraCrypt support to GNOME Files

We added preliminary support to unlock normal (i.e. non-hidden, non-system-volume, without keyfiles) VeraCrypt volumes via GVfs monitor ([[!tails_ticket 15218]]). We found difficulties regarding modifications of the unlock dialog used by GVfs, and [reached out to the GTK developers to ask for advise](https://mail.gnome.org/archives/gtk-devel-list/2018-January/msg00037.html).

# B. Additional software

## B.1 UX & UI design sprint

The main developer and the UX designer working on this project gathered for
three days of sprint in Berlin, at the Onion Space, a coworking space for
Internet freedom technologists, on January 27, 28, and 29.

We followed a very similar methodology as the one we described in more
details when we reported on the [[UX design sprint for VeraCrypt support
in GNOME|contribute/reports/SponsorW/2017_12#sprint]].

### Design studio

We started with a [design
studio](https://articles.uie.com/design_studio_methodology/) to ideate
and come up with a first design candidate.

### Paper prototyping and formative testing with users

We prepared paper prototypes of this first candidate. Over the week-end,
we had 7 people come over for testing sessions of one hour each. After
each test we debriefed our findings and improved our design.

We selected people with diverse prior knowledge about how to install
packages in Tails (and Linux in general). All were familiar with Tails
(though to various degrees) but some were otherwise Windows or macOS
users while some were Debian experts or used to Linux distributions with
a different packaging system.

### Output

The full list of interfaces that we designed can be seen on our
[[blueprint|blueprint/additional_software_packages/gui]].

The complete XML wireframes are on
[GitHub](https://github.com/sajolida/tails-wireframes/tree/master/additional%20software)
and here are the most relevant parts.

## B.2. Write technical design documentation

We drafted
[[an initial technical design|blueprint/additional_software_packages/gui/]] of
the components that will implement the user experience described above.

## B.3. Write automated tests

We wrote the [[!tails_ticket 14572 desc="automated tests"]] for the Offline
Mode feature (activity B.5). Once we complete our review process they
will be included in the upcoming Tails release (3.6).

## B.4. Implement backend and GUI

We started to implement the [[!tails_ticket 14594 desc="backend code"]].

## B.5. Implement offline mode

The
[[!tails_ticket 14570 desc="Offline Mode for Additional Software Packages"]]
will be merged once we complete our review process for the
corresponding automated tests (activity B.3) and then
included in the next Tails release (3.6).

## B.8. Fix bugs and UX issues

The bugfix for
[[!tails_ticket 9059 desc="Additional software locking the opening of the desktop"]]
has been merged and will be released in the next Tails release.
