# A. VeraCrypt support in GNOME

## A.1 Research user needs and development costs

We bootstrapped the project, discussed internally a calendar for the UX
design sprint, the alpha version, and the final release.

**User needs**: We benchmarked different [open source survey
platforms](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-ux/2017-September/003472.html)
and decided to use [*LimeSurvey*](https://www.limesurvey.org/) to
conduct the online quantitative survey that will help us determine which
features and use cases for VeraCrypt we should prioritize in the best
interest of both our existing and prospective user base.

**Development costs**:
We looked at the relevant code bases of udisks and GNOME Disks to get a rough estimate of the development cost to implement the VeraCrypt support.

## A.4 Add VeraCrypt support to udisks

We extended udisks to support locking and unlocking of VeraCrypt volumes. The code is available in [a fork of udisks on GitHub](https://github.com/segfault3/udisks/tree/support-truecrypt). The progress is tracked in [[!tails_ticket 6337]].

# B. Additional software

We bootstrapped the project, discussed internally a calendar for the UX
design sprint, the alpha version, and the final release.
