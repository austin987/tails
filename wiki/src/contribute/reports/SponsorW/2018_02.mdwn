# A. VeraCrypt support in GNOME

## A.4 Add VeraCrypt support to udisks

We added support for unlocking system volumes and using VeraCrypt PIMs
in udisks ([[!tails_ticket 15215]]) and libblockdev ([[!tails_ticket
15216]]). During this work we discovered two bugs in cryptsetup, which
will be fixed in the next cryptsetup release
([#366](https://gitlab.com/cryptsetup/cryptsetup/issues/366),[#367](https://gitlab.com/cryptsetup/cryptsetup/issues/367)).

The features for VeraCrypt support in udisks and libblockdev are now all
implemented, so we created pull requests for our work in
[libblockdev](https://github.com/storaged-project/libblockdev/pull/320)
and [udisks](https://github.com/storaged-project/udisks/pull/495).

## A.5 Add VeraCrypt support to GNOME Disks

We extended the volume unlock dialog in GNOME Disks to allow specifying
the parameters required to unlock VeraCrypt volumes ([[!tails_ticket
15217]]).

The features for VeraCrypt support in GNOME Disks are now also complete,
so we [asked the maintainers to review and merge our
work](https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/devkit-devel/2018-February/001818.html).

# B. Additional software

## B.5 Implement offline mode

The offline mode will be released in Tails 3.6 ([[!tails_ticket 14570]])
and this activity is completed.
