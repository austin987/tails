[[!meta title="About creating Tails derivatives"]]

What for:

- Include additional features that we are not ready to add to Tails (for example
  to include GNUnet or Namecoin).
- Have custom branding or configuration.
- Provide ISO images with less or different features (for example to
  have VPN instead of Tor).

Why is it complicated:

- Release every 6 weeks, plus the occasional unscheduled emergency
  security release
- Heavy quality assurance process (automated builds and tests)
- Complex infrastructure (upgrades)
- User trust (authenticated downloads, OpenPGP Web-of-Trust)
- Fingerprinting & partitioning users into a anonymity subset
- For features that are not in Tails because there has been no time or
  solution for doing them correctly, the temptation to just shove them
  in hastily and call it done

Good ways of doing it:

- Don't build your own ISO images.
- Package your specific applications in Debian to make them easier to
  use in Tails.
- Document how to use your specific applications in Tails.
- Rely on the mechanisms already available in Tails to adapt it to your
  needs (additional software packages, persistent storage).
- Help us build in Tails other mechanisms that you might need to adapt
  it to your needs (for example to have persistent DConf settings or APT
  sources).
- Talk with us to see how we can adapt our ISO images and source code to make them
  easier for your to reuse.
- If you want to include a piece of software into Tails, talk to us as
  early as possible so we can provide feedback on how to integrate it.

Open questions:

- Trademark aspects. Will derivatives appear as being "Tails" to their
  users while having different security features than Tails?  Shall we
  review ourselves the work of derivatives and "endorse" them? How could
  crappy derivatives impact negatively the name and reputation of Tails?
