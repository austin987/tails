<div id="intro">

<p>New contributors can get started with the [[how to contribute code
to Tails|contribute/how/code]] documentation.</p>

<p>Tails is developed in a set of [[Git repositories|contribute/git]]. Slightly
different merge policies apply to contributors depending on their
involvement level. On the other hand, some rules apply to anyone. This
page documents both.</p>
