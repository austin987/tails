Git repository and branches
===========================

You will need to clone the Tails Git repository, and to checkout the
branch that you want to build (most likely, _not_ `master`): learn
more about [[our Git branches layout|contribute/git#main-repo]].

Using Vagrant
=============

Tails can be built easily in a virtual machine using [Rake], [Vagrant] and
[VirtualBox]. The process requires a minimum of 1 GB of free memory and a
maximum of 10 GB of free storage.

[Vagrant]: http://vagrantup.com/
[VirtualBox]: http://www.virtualbox.org/

## Installing the dependencies in Debian

### If you run Debian Jessie

1. Add Debian unstable to your APT sources:

       echo "deb http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/ unstable main" | \
           sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/unstable.list

2. Pin all packages from Debian unstable at 500 (`apt_preferences(5)`):

       sudo tee /etc/apt/preferences.d/unstable <<EOF
       Package: *
       Pin: release o=Debian,a=unstable
       Pin-Priority: 500
       EOF

3. Install the needed tools:

       sudo apt-get install git virtualbox rake ruby-childprocess \
           ruby-erubis ruby-i18n ruby-log4r ruby-net-scp ruby bsdtar curl

### If you run Debian Wheezy

1. Add Debian Jessie, unstable and wheezy-backports to your APT sources:

       echo "deb http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/ jessie main" | \
           sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jessie.list
       echo "deb http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/ unstable main" | \
           sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/unstable.list
       echo "deb http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/ wheezy-backports main" | \
           sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/wheezy-backports.list

2. Pin all packages from Debian Jessie and unstable at 500 (`apt_preferences(5)`):

       sudo tee /etc/apt/preferences.d/jessie <<EOF
       Package: *
       Pin: release o=Debian,a=jessie
       Pin-Priority: 500
       EOF
       sudo tee /etc/apt/preferences.d/unstable <<EOF
       Package: *
       Pin: release o=Debian,a=unstable
       Pin-Priority: 500
       EOF

3. Install the needed tools:

       sudo apt-get install git virtualbox rake ruby-childprocess/jessie \
           ruby-net-scp/jessie ruby-erubis ruby-i18n ruby-log4r bsdtar curl \
           gettext/wheezy-backports

### In both Debian Wheezy and Jessie

At the moment Tails relies on a version of Vagrant (the 1.4.x series)
that is not packaged in Debian any more. Here's a workaround for both
Debian Wheezy and Jessie:

    sudo tee /etc/apt/preferences.d/tails-build-vagrant <<EOF
    Package: vagrant
    Pin: version 1.4.3+dfsg1-3
    Pin-Priority: 550

    Package: ruby-net-ssh
    Pin: version 1:2.6.8-2
    Pin-Priority: 550
    EOF
    echo "deb http://snapshot.debian.org/archive/debian/20141010T042049Z/ unstable main" | \
        sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/20141010T042049Z.list
    sudo apt-get -o Acquire::Check-Valid-Until=false update
    sudo apt-get install vagrant ruby-net-ssh
    sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/20141010T042049Z.list
    sudo apt-get update

## Building Tails using Vagrant

Once all dependencies are installed, get the Tails sources and
checkout the development branch:

    git clone git://git.tails.boum.org/tails
    cd tails
    git checkout devel

Build Tails using Vagrant:

    rake build

The first time, this can take a little while to download the base virtual
machine from Tails mirror (around 300 MB). It will then boot the machine,
set it up and start the build process. When done, several `tails-*` files
should appear in the current directory.

After you are done working on Tails, do not forget to shut the virtual
machine down:

    rake vm:halt

One may also want to [[contribute/customize]] their image before building.

To know all available Rake tasks, please run `rake -T`.

Local HTTP proxy
----------------

If you have a local HTTP proxy, the build system will use it as long as
you properly set the `http_proxy` environment variable. The easiest way to
do so is to run:

    export http_proxy=http://proxy.lan:3142

This needs to be done before any other operations.

Build options
-------------

Options regarding the build process can be set using the
`TAILS_BUILD_OPTIONS` environment variable. Muliple options must be
separated by whitespaces.

The following options are available:

### Memory build settings

Tails builds way faster when everything is done in memory. If your computer
runs Linux and happens to have more than 7 GB of free memory before you
start the virtual machine, it will automatically switch to 'build in RAM'
mode.

To force a specific behaviour please set:

 * **ram**: start the virtual machine with 7 GB of memory, build Tails
   inside a `tmpfs`. Build fails if the system is not in a proper state to
   do so.
 * **noram**: start the virtual machine with 512 MB of memory if not already
   done, build Tails using the virtual machine hard disk.

### HTTP proxy settings

Building Tails requires downloading a little bit more than 1 GB of Debian
packages. To preserve bandwidth and developer sanity, using a HTTP proxy is
nearly a must. Tails virtual machine contains a fully configured local HTTP
proxy that will be used if no other local proxy is defined.

The following flags can be used to force a specific behaviour:

 * **extproxy**: use the proxy configured through the `http_proxy`
   environment variable. Fail if it is not set.
 * **vmproxy**: use the local proxy configured in the virtual machine even
   if a local HTTP proxy is set.
 * **noproxy**: do not use any HTTP proxy.

### SquashFS compression settings

One of the most expensive operations when building Tails is the creation
of the final SquashFS. It also depends on the compression algorithm used.
When working on the `stable` or `testing` branch, the image will be made
using the slow but efficient default. Any other setup will switch to the
faster *gzip*.

Forcing a specific behaviour can be done using:

 * **gzipcomp**: always use *gzip* to create the SquashFS.
 * **defaultcomp**: always use the default compression algorithm.

### Clean-up settings

Some operations are preserved accross builds. Currently they are:

* The wiki (for documentation).

In case you want to delete all these, the following option is available:

 * **cleanall**: force a clean up before starting the build.

### Virtual CPUs settings

The number of virtual CPUs that are allocated in the virtual machine can be set
through:

 * **cpus=_n_**: allocate _n_ CPUs to the virtual machine.

Obviously you should not allocate more virtual CPUs than the number of cores
available to the host system. When using Linux, the number of CPUs allocated
will default to be the same as the host system.

### Git settings

The build system can only work on files that have been *commited* to the Git
repository. By default, it will refuse to start a build in presence of
uncommited changes. This behaviour can be controlled by:

 * **ignorechanges**: allow to make a build that will ignore changes in the Git
   repository.

### Example

The fastest build you could pretend to get can be done by setting:

    export TAILS_BUILD_OPTIONS="ram cache extproxy gzipcomp"

This will force the build to happen in RAM and allow skipping the
boostrap stage if one is cached, and will use use an HTTP proxy
external to the virtual machine, and SquashFS compression will be done
using *gzip*.

Building manually
=================

In order to build Tails manually, you need a running [Debian
Wheezy](https://www.debian.org/releases/wheezy/) system
and some [backports](http://backports.debian.org/). Anything else
will fail.

Dependencies
------------

The following Debian packages need to be installed:

* our `live-build` 2.x package, adapted for Wheezy. Its version is
  something like *3.0.5+really+is+2.0.12-0.tails1*. One can install it
  from:

      deb http://deb.tails.boum.org/ builder-wheezy main

  This APT repository's signing key can be found on the keyservers.
  It is certified by the [[!tails_website tails-signing.key
  desc="Tails signing key"]], and its fingerprint is:

      221F 9A3C 6FA3 E09E 182E  060B C798 8EA7 A358 D82E

* `syslinux-utils` 6.03, e.g. from our `builder-wheezy` repository
  just like `live-build`
* `eatmydata`, `time` and `whois` (for `/usr/bin/mkpasswd`)
* `ikiwiki` 3.20120725 or newer, available in wheezy-backports.
* `apt-get install libyaml-perl libyaml-libyaml-perl po4a perlmagick
  libyaml-syck-perl` so that the wiki builds smoothly.
* `dpkg-dev`
* `intltool`
* `gettext` 0.18.3 or newer, available in wheezy-backports

Configure live-build
--------------------

Remove any line matching `/^[[:space:]]*LB.*MIRROR.*=/` in
`/etc/live/build.conf`.

Build process
-------------

Every build command must be run as `root`, at the root of a clone of the
[[`tails` repository|git]].

In short, a build shall be done using:

    lb clean --all && lb config && lb build

Running `lb config` or `lb build` in an environment that wasn't full
cleaned first is not supported.

### Customize the build process if needed

If you need to set custom build settings that are specific to your
local environment, such as a custom Debian mirror or APT proxy, you
probably want to configure live-build a bit.

The most common customizations are documented on this wiki:

* to avoid compressing the SquashFS using XZ (efficient, but very
  slow), `export MKSQUASHFS_OPTIONS='-comp gzip'` in your
  build environment;
* [[using a custom Debian mirror to build Tails
  images|build/custom_mirror]];
* [[using squid-deb-proxy to build Tails images|build/squid-deb-proxy]]
  (**Note**: most Tails contributors using the manual build method
  use [[!debpts apt-cacher-ng]] instead, nowadays.)

More documentation about this can be found in the [Debian Live
Manual](http://live.debian.net/manual-2.x/html/live-manual.en.html).
