[[!meta title="Building a Tails image"]]

The following instructions will lead you through the process of building
a Tails ISO image with [Rake], [Vagrant] and [vagrant-libvirt].

[Vagrant]: http://vagrantup.com/
[vagrant-libvirt]: https://github.com/vagrant-libvirt/vagrant-libvirt/

# Requirements

To build Tails you need:

 * Debian 9 (Stretch) or newer
 * the KVM virtual machine hypervisor
 * at least 1 GiB of free RAM
 * 20 GB of free storage

# Setup the build environment

1. To install everything the Tails build system needs, execute the
   following command:

       sudo apt install \
           psmisc \
           git \
           rake \
           libvirt-daemon-system \
           dnsmasq-base \
           ebtables \
           qemu-system-x86 \
           qemu-utils \
           vagrant \
           vagrant-libvirt \
           vmdebootstrap && \
       sudo systemctl restart libvirtd

2. Ensure your user can run commands as root with `sudo`.

3. Ensure your user is in the relevant groups:

       for group in kvm libvirt libvirt-qemu ; do
          sudo adduser "$(whoami)" "$group"
       done

4. Logout and log back in to apply the new group memberships.

# Build Tails

1. To get the Tails sources and checkout the
   [[development branch|contribute/git#main-repo]], execute the
   following commands:

        git clone https://git-tails.immerda.ch/tails && \
        cd tails && \
        git checkout devel && \
        git submodule update --init

2. To build an ISO image, execute the following command:

        rake build && rake vm:halt

   When the build completes, several `tails-*` files
   will appear in the current directory.

You may also want to [[contribute/customize]] the content of the ISO
image before building it.

# Known issues and workarounds

* If Vagrant fails to start the Tails builder VM with an error similar
  to:

        Virtio-9p Failed to initialize fs-driver with id:fsdev-fs0

  … then see [[!tails_ticket 11411]].

* If Vagrant fails to start the Tails builder VM with:

        Initialization parameters must be an attributes hash, got NilClass nil (ArgumentError)

  … then restart the libvirtd service:

        sudo systemctl restart libvirtd.service

  Finally, try building again.

* If Vagrant failed to start the Tails builder VM the first time
  (e.g. because of permission issues or the `kvm` module not being
  loaded) it will not automatically run the provisioning script, so
  you must run `rake vm:provision` yourself before attempting your
  first `rake build`. If that fails, run `rake vm:destroy`, which
  removes this half-broken VM, and then start from scratch with
  `rake build` or similar.

# Build settings

You can customize the build system using two environment variables:

 * `ARTIFACTS` is the path where the ISO image is stored once the
   build completes; for example:

        ARTIFACTS='/path/to/directory'

 * To tweak other build settings, use `TAILS_BUILD_OPTIONS`,
   a space-separated list of build options documented below.

   For example, you can speed up the build by setting:

        export TAILS_BUILD_OPTIONS="ram gzipcomp"

   This will force the build to happen in RAM and SquashFS compression
   will be done using *gzip*.

## SquashFS compression settings

One of the most expensive operations when building Tails is the creation
of the final SquashFS. It also depends on the compression algorithm used.
When working on the `stable` or `testing` branch, the image will be made
using the slow but efficient default. Any other setup will switch to the
faster *gzip*.

Forcing a specific behaviour can be done using:

 * **gzipcomp**: always use *gzip* to create the SquashFS.
 * **defaultcomp**: always use the default compression algorithm.

## Memory build settings

Tails builds way faster when everything is done in memory. If your computer
runs Linux and happens to have enough free memory before you
start the virtual machine, it will automatically switch to 'build in RAM'
mode.

To force a specific behaviour please set:

 * **ram**: start the virtual machine with lots of memory, build Tails
   inside a `tmpfs`. Build fails if the system is not in a proper state to
   do so.
 * **noram**: start the virtual machine with the bare minimum needed memory if not already
   done, build Tails using the virtual machine hard disk.

## Network settings

 * **offline**: This option will make the build system do its best to
   not depend on the network, e.g. if you use the VM's caching proxy
   if will *only* use cached APT lists and packages. Use this when you
   do not have an Internet connection.

## Git settings

You can force the build system to handle the Git tree in a special
way:

 * **ignorechanges**: allow to make a build that will ignore changes in the Git
   repository.

   The build system can only work on files that have been *committed* to the Git
   repository. By default, it will refuse to start a build in presence of
   uncommitted changes.

 * **mergebasebranch**: if building from a branch (not tag!) this
   forces a merge of the base branch before the build process starts
   for real. This is mostly meant for our Jenkins deployment, so use
   at your own risk.

## Variations useful for testing build reproducibility

These options allow one to vary the build environment in ways that may
affect reproducibility of the ISO image:

 * **dateoffset=_+n_**, **dateoffset=_-n_**: change the virtual
   machine system time by _+n_ or _-n_ days.

 * **cpus=_n_**: allocate _n_ CPUs to the virtual machine.
   Obviously you should not allocate more virtual CPUs than the number
   of cores available to the host system. When using Linux, the number
   of CPUs allocated will default to be the same as the host system.

 * **cpumodel=_model_**: type of the CPUs allocated to the virtual
   machine. See
   [the corresponding libvirt documentation](https://libvirt.org/formatdomain.html#elementsCPU).

 * **machinetype=_type_**: type of the QEMU machine; see the output of
   `qemu-system-x86_64 -machine help` for available options.

## Developer convenience settings

 * **keeprunning**: do not clean up the builder VM on build
   success.

 * **forcecleanup**: ensure a new builder VM is used for `rake build`,
   and also clean up this VM after the build, no matter if it
   succeeded or not.

 * **rescue**: implies **keeprunning** and will also not clean up the
   build directory, which is useful for investigating build failures.

## HTTP proxy settings

Building Tails requires downloading a little bit more than 2 GiB of
data. By default, the build system will configure and use its own HTTP
caching proxy in order to speed up the following builds.

We recommend against modifying this behavior, but you can do it with
the following build options:

 * **extproxy**: use the external proxy configured through the `http_proxy`
   environment variable. Fail if it is not set.

   <div class="bug">

   <ul>

     <li>An external HTTP proxy does not save any download bandwidth unless
     configured in a very special and undocumented way.</li>

     <li>At least one step of the build does not honor the external proxy
     settings, so outgoing Internet connections from the build VM must be
     allowed to go through anyway.</li>

   </ul>

   </div>

 * **vmproxy**: use the local proxy configured in the virtual machine even
   if a local HTTP proxy is set.

 * **noproxy**: do not use any HTTP proxy.
