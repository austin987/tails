[[!meta title="Vagrant"]]

Tails can be [[built|contribute/build]] in a virtual machine that is
managed using [Vagrant] and [vagrant-libvirt]. Here lies more details
on how Tails uses Vagrant, its configuration, and how to create and
upload the template virtual machine.

Configuration
=============

Vagrant support files are located in the `vagrant` directory at the root of the
[[amnesia.git|contribute/git]] repository.

This directory contains:

 * `Vagrantfile`: [configuration file for Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com/docs/vagrantfile/),
 * `provision/setup-tails-builder`: idempotent provisioning script that is
   run inside the virtual machine upon boot,
 * `provision/assets/build-tails`: build script to be run inside the
   virtual machine,
 * to build the base box:
   - `definitions/tails-builder/generate-tails-builder-box.sh`: Script
     that generates the base box.
   - `definitions/tails-builder/postinstall.sh`: Script that is run
     inside the base box before finalizing it, e.g. for installing the
     packages we need.
   - `vagrant/lib/tails_build_settings.rb` defines the basebox properties
     (memory, Debian version, architecture, ...) and the basebox name.

We choose to use the [Shell
provisioner](http://vagrantup.com/docs/provisioners/shell.html), as long as we
make this script reentrant it will lower the learning curve for contributors
not familiar with Puppet or Chef.

The Tails [[!tails_gitweb vagrant/Vagrantfile desc="Vagrantfile"]] is
configured to share the local clone of the Tails repository inside the running
basebox through a 9pfs mount.

Automated basebox creation
==========================

While implementing [[reproducible builds|blueprint/reproducible_builds]] of
Tails, we choose to automate the basebox creation. Rather than downloading a
big binary, everyone building Tails for the first time will start by generating
the approriate basebox if it's not already available locally.

To ensure that the baseboxes are identical enough, we defined a mechanism for
its generation:

To freeze the build environment, we use APT snapshots in the same way we do in
the Tails build system, by storing the serials for the various APT repositories
in [[!tails_gitweb_dir
vagrant/definitions/tails-builder/config/APT_snapshots.d/]].

Only the debian-security APT source uses Debian's APT repository, so that we
get security fixes. This will probably not influence the reproducibility of the
ISO. This is done in the [[!tails_gitweb vagrant/provision/setup-tails-builder
desc="Vagrant provisioning script"]].

To ensure that changes in the Vagrant build system are still taken into account
when using a basebox, we dynamically set the name of the basebox by including
the short ID of the last commit in the `vagrant` directory in the related
branch, as well as its date, in the name of the basebox. That's done with
[[!tails_gitweb_dir vagrant/lib/tails_build_settings.rb]] as explained above.

We update the basebox APT snapshots serials [[at every Tails
release|contribute/APT_repository/time-based_snapshots#bump-expiration-date-for-all-snapshots]].

A new VM is created from the basebox for each build. After the build, the VM is
destroyed ([[!tails_ticket 11980]] and [[!tails_ticket 11981]]).

The `keeprunning` build option can be used so that the VM is kept running and
reused for subsequent builds of the same branch.

The VM encodes (in `/var/lib/vagrant_box_build_from`) the branch for which it
has been started for. The ISO build aborts if the branch being built is not the
same as the one that is encoded in this file. This prevents the reuse of a
running VM to build another branch than the one it has been started for
initially.

To ensure that the `apt-cacher-ng` cache is not lost when the VM is destroyed,
it is stored in a dedicated virtual disk, and plugged into every new build VM.

Jenkins
=======

All these features and the [[basic ones|contribute/build]] are used by our
Jenkins ISO builders. See [[here for
specifics|contribute/working_together/roles/sysadmins/automated_builds_in_Jenkins]].
