[[!meta title="Build a local copy of the website"]]

The website [[https://tails.boum.org/]] is built using
[Ikiwiki](https://ikiwiki.info) from source code that is available in
our main Git repository, along with the rest of the Tails code.

You can build a local copy of the website on any Debian system, including Tails.

Building the
website produces a set a HTML pages stored on your system that you can
open in your usual web browser even while working offline. Doing so is
useful for writers and designers to see how their
changes will apply on the website.

1. Update the list of available packages:

        sudo apt update

2. Install the required packages:

        sudo apt install \
           ikiwiki \
           libyaml-perl \
           libyaml-libyaml-perl \
           libyaml-syck-perl \
           perlmagick \
           po4a \
           ruby

3. Clone our main [[Git repository|git]]:

        git clone https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails.git

   <div class="tip">

   <p>The source code of the website is located in the
   <span class="filename">wiki/src/</span> folder.</p>

   </div>

4. If you want to display the search box in the banner of your local build,
   uncomment the following line in *ikiwiki.setup*:

       # -  search

5. Build the website:

        cd tails && \
        ./build-website

   <div class="tip">

   <p>To accelerate the build, you can disable some languages by editing
   the <span class="code">po_slave_languages</span> parameter in the file
   <span class="filename">ikiwiki.setup</span>.</p>

   </div>

6. You can now browse your local copy of the website in the following folder:

   <span class="filename">config/chroot_local-includes/usr/share/doc/tails/website/</span>
