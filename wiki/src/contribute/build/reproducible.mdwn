What are reproducible builds?
=============================

> Reproducible builds are a set of software development practices that
> create a verifiable path from human readable source code to the binary
> code used by computers.

> Most aspects of software verification are done on source code, as that
> is what humans can reasonably understand. But most of the time,
> computers require software to be first built into a long string of
> numbers to be used. With reproducible builds, multiple parties can redo
> this process independently and ensure they all get exactly the same
> result. We can thus gain confidence that a distributed binary code is
> indeed coming from a given source code.

(Quoted from <https://reproducible-builds.org>)

Tails ISO and USB images should be reproducible: everybody who
builds one of them should be able to obtain the exact same resulting
image from a given Git tag.

Why is it important?
====================

Reproducibility increases confidence in the value of our continuous
quality assurance processes as well as the trust that users, and anyone
interested can put into our released build products (such as ISO and USB
images) and our development and release process.

Reproducible builds help [detect
bugs](https://reproducible-builds.org/docs/buy-in/) and ensure that
there is no bit flip that makes us waste precious hours during a release
process.

Most important, a reproducible build allows for independent verification
that a build product matches what the source intended to produce. This
helps to better resist [attacks against build machines and
developers](https://reproducible-builds.org/docs/buy-in/), improves
users' security, and allows developers to sleep better at night (as the
incentive for an attacker to compromise developers' systems, or to
compromise developers themselves, is lowered). In turn, this avoids the
need to trust people (or software) who build the ISO and USB images we
release, which in turn allows more people to get involved in release
management work.

Release managers do not have to upload the ISO and USB images anymore when they
do a release: they can  instead build it both on our infrastructure
(Jenkins) and locally and compare the outputs: if they match, one can
publish the ISO and USB images built by Jenkins. Uploading the ISO and USB
images can take many hours
with some commonly found means of accessing the Internet, so removing
the need to go through this step decreases our time to remediation for
fixing security issues, and makes it easier for developers with poor
access to the Internet to take care of a release.

Build and compare Tails ISO and USB images
==========================================

Build Tails ISO and USB images
------------------------------

See the [[build instructions|contribute/build]].

<a id="verify-iso"></a>
How do I verify the image I have built against the official one?
----------------------------------------------------------------

You can verify that the image you have built is identical to the
official one we published either with OpenPGP or with a checksum.

### Verify with OpenPGP

When you reproducibly build our image you should obtain a file that is
exactly the same as the official Tails image, thus, *our* signature
should be able to verify *your* image for you.

[[Download and verify our OpenPGP signature|/install/download#openpgp]]
against your own ISO or USB image.

### Verify with a checksum

To verify that the ISO or USB image you have built is identical as the
official one:

1. Compute the checksum of your image by executing one of the following
   commands on it:

        sha256sum yourimage.iso
        sha256sum yourimage.img

2. Compare the SHA-256 checksum of your images with the ones found
   in the official [image description file](https://tails.boum.org/install/v2/Tails/amd64/stable/latest.json).

Build and compare a Tails upgrade (IUK)
=======================================

Build a Tails IUK
-----------------

See
[[Build the Incremental Upgrade Kits|contribute/release_process#prepare-iuk]]
section in our Release process documentation.

Verify IUKs
-----------

You can get the SHA-256 of any IUK by setting the `SOURCE` and
`TARGET` variables appropriately, for example:

    # For Tails_amd64_3.0_to_3.1.iuk
    SOURCE=3.0
    TARGET=3.1

and then run:

    UDF="wiki/src/upgrade/v2/Tails/${SOURCE}/amd64/stable/upgrades.yml"
    if gpg --verify ${UDF}.pgp ${UDF}; then
      python3 <<EOF
    import yaml
    with open('${UDF}') as f:
      data = yaml.load(f)
    upgrade = next(x for x in data['upgrades']
                   if x['version'] == '${TARGET}')
    incremental = next(x for x in upgrade['upgrade-paths']
                       if x['type'] == 'incremental')
    iuk = next(x for x in incremental['target-files']
               if x['url'].endswith('Tails_amd64_${SOURCE}_to_${TARGET}.iuk'))
    print('SHA-256:', iuk['sha256'])
    EOF
    else
      echo 'OpenPGP verification of the UDF failed. Are you sure you have ' \
           'Tails signing key imported into you keyring?' >&2
    fi
