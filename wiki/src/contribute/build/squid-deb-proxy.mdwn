[[!meta title="Using squid-deb-proxy to build Tails images"]]

[[!toc levels=2]]

# Why?

The Debian mirrors live-build uses are very much configurable (see
[[build/custom_mirror]]), but Tails uses some non-Debian APT
repositories whose location cannot be adapted to your build
environment using only live-build settings.

Moreover, some packages fetch data online over HTTP at install time
i.e. at Tails build time.

Both of these factors make it hard to build Tails offline... unless
you have a HTTP proxy with all necessary files cached on disk, that is
able to switch to offline mode.

# How?

## Install and configure squid-deb-proxy

squid-deb-proxy is a Debian proxy solution based on Squid with a
tweaked configuration. It has a [homepage on
Launchpad](https://launchpad.net/squid-deb-proxy) and packages in
Ubuntu.

On the other hand, we've found the upstream and Ubuntu packages to
require many changes to be usable in Debian and especially for Tails
purposes. Until we manage to turn our changes into a proper Debian
package and make them generic enough to be pushed upstream, we
recommend using the installation instructions bellow.

1. Install necessary dependencies:

           apt-get install squid3

2. Create the necessary directories:

           install -o root  -g root -m 00755 -d /etc/squid-deb-proxy
           install -o proxy -g root -m 00750 -d /var/cache/squid-deb-proxy
           install -o proxy -g root -m 00750 -d /var/log/squid-deb-proxy

3. Install the attached configuration files; all shall be owned by
   `root:root` and have `00644` permissions unless otherwise noted:

 * [[/etc/squid-deb-proxy/squid-deb-proxy.conf|squid-deb-proxy/squid-deb-proxy.conf]]
   is the main configuration file passed to Squid3.
 * [[/etc/squid-deb-proxy/allowed-networks-src.acl|squid-deb-proxy/allowed-networks-src.acl]]
   lists the network sources that are allowed to access the cache
 * [[/etc/squid-deb-proxy/mirror-dstdomain.acl|squid-deb-proxy/mirror-dstdomain.acl]]
   lists the network destinations the proxy is allowed to reach
 * [[/etc/init.d/squid-deb-proxy|squid-deb-proxy/squid-deb-proxy]] is
   the initscript; it needs to be made executable.

4. Adapt the configuration for your needs:

 * The example `cache_mem` setting shall be changed depending on the
   amount of RAM your build machine has
 * The example `cache_dir` has a 10G limit that is a bit high if you
   only want to use squid-deb-proxy to build Tails.

5. Have the proxy start on boot:

           update-rc.d squid-deb-proxy defaults

6. Start the proxy:

           invoke-rc.d squid-deb-proxy start

## Use the proxy for live-build and APT

You need to set a few options in live-build's configuration file
(`/etc/live/build.conf`).

First, the following line asks live-build to use the configured proxy
for any use of APT it makes:

	LB_APT_HTTP_PROXY="http://127.0.0.1:8000/"

Second, you probably need to [[ask live-build to use a custom Debian
mirror|build/custom_mirror]] to fit the destination domain
restrictions you set previously up.

## Use the proxy for non-APT purposes

Export the `http_proxy='http://127.0.0.1:8000/'` environment variable
in the (root) shell you want to run the build in. This way, HTTP
requests that are made by anyone else than APT during the build will
use the configured Squid proxy.

## Build offline

Un-comment the settings in the *Offline mode* section at the end of
`/etc/squid-deb-proxy/squid-deb-proxy.conf`.
