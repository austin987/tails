[[!meta title="Git merge policy: how to submit code"]]

All development should happen in topic branches. For a new feature XXX, it should
be named `feature/XXX`. For a bugfix about YYY, it should be named
`bugfix/YYY`. Ideally, include the relevant ticket number in the topic
branch name, e.g. `bugfix/7173-upgrade-syslinux`.

When the developer thinks it is good enough and has tested it, she must:

- if you have access to our Jenkins instance (if you don't know what
  this means, you do not) please make sure that your branch has not
  broken any tests!
- set the ticket's *Status* field to *In Progress* (if you do not see
  this field when editing the ticket, ask the [[sysadmin team|contribute/working_together/roles/sysadmins]]
  to grant you the necessary permissions)
- set the ticket's *QA Check* field to *Ready for QA*
- assign this ticket to nobody (aka. unassign it from yourself) by
  default. Unless it's clear to you that nobody on the
  [[Foundations Team|working_together/roles/foundations_team]] will be
  able or willing to do this specific review; in that case, _you_ shall try
  to find someone else to do the review, and assign the ticket
  to them.
- point the ticket's *Feature Branch* field to your branch
- set the ticket's *Target version* field to the release you would
  like your changes to be in
- for important changes, if you feel the need to ask input from the
  greater development community, notify the [[tails-dev@boum.org|about/contact#tails-dev]]
  mailing list

Then, if the [[reviewer|contribute/merge_policy/review]] asks for more
development to be done before
merging, they should set the ticket's *QA Check* field back to *Needs
more dev* or *Needs more info* state, and
from now on it's the responsibility of the branch/ticket "holder" to
change it back to *Ready for QA* once they consider the issues raised by
the reviewer are fixed.
