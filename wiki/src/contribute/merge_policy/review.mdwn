[[!meta title="How to review and merge proposed changes"]]

We use [[!tails_gitlab desc="GitLab"]] for tracking issues, merge requests, and
code. Please ensure you are familiar with [[how we use GitLab at
Tails|contribute/working_together/GitLab]].

In particular, see
[[how to participate in discussions|working_together/GitLab#discussions]].

## Review

- Assign the [[!tails_gitlab help/user/project/merge_requests/index.md desc="Merge
  Request"]] to you. This avoids duplicating work.
- Verify that the destination branch matches what's in `config/base_branch` on
  the branch, and is correct:
  - for a new feature: into `devel`
  - for a fix on top on the last RC: into `testing`; then merge
    `testing` into `devel`
  - for a fix on top of the last stable: into `stable`; then merge
    `stable` into `devel`
- Merge the destination branch of the MR into the topic branch.
- Build the topic branch and test the feature.
- Check automated ISO build and test results on
  <https://jenkins.tails.boum.org/>.
- Review the diff, either in the GitLab interface or on the command line.
  If you're using the command line, beware of changes introduced
  by merge commits: either add the `--cc` option to `git log`, or use
  `git diff` after reviewing the individual patches.
- Check the contents of every APT overlay that the branch enables:

  - If you have upload rights to our [[custom APT
    repository|contribute/APT_repository/custom]]:

        ssh reprepro@incoming.deb.tails.boum.org \
            reprepro list ${APT_overlay}`

  - Else:

    - <https://deb.tails.boum.org/dists/${APT_overlay}/main/source/Sources>
    - <https://deb.tails.boum.org/dists/${APT_overlay}/main/binary-amd64/Packages>

- Check the user and design documentation.
- Check the corresponding GitLab issue.
- Ensure the description of the MR includes `Closes #NNNN`
  statements for the issues fixed by this MR.
  <a id="closes"></a>
  <a id="fix-committed"></a>
- Changes proposed by new contributors, or by the patch'n'forget kind,
  shall respectively be applied once they are in *good enough* state.
  That is, once the core developers team feels like maintaining it on
  the long run in case the initial submitter disappears. Such
  maintenance includes: polishing the proposed changes to make them fit
  for release; writing and updating the design and end-user
  documentations; fixing bugs.
- As reviewer, you are allowed to commit trivial fixes on top of the
  proposed branch to avoid round-trips: for example, fixing typos
  and improving phrasing of comments and strings.
  Then, report back about these changes on the MR.

## Give feedback

First, remember that it's hard to receive negative feedback. Don't forget
to note the good parts, be constructive and precise in your
comments, and never use reviews to make personal attacks. You can
read these blog posts on review and feedback:

  - [Kate Heddleston: Criticism and ineffective feedback](https://www.kateheddleston.com/blog/criticism-and-ineffective-feedback) (blog post on how to do a good review)
  - [Liane Davey: Maybe you shouldn't give feedback](http://www.3coze.com/2016/07/17/bite-your-tongue/)

As part of your review, if you spot problems that block the merge
in your opinion:

1. Give feedback about these problems.
2. Reassign the MR to the person who proposed the branch.
3. On the corresponding issue: replace the *Needs Validation* label
   with *Doing*.

## Merge

1. Click the *Merge* button on the MR.

   If you are not authorized to do so, instead:

    - Add a comment on the MR to say you have reviewed the branch.
      If you approve its merging, say so.
    - De-assign yourself from the MR.

2. Close the issues fixed by this MR.

   You don't need to do this if the destination branch of the MR
   is `master`: these issues will be closed automatically.

3. If the destination branch of the MR was `stable`, then
   pull `stable` locally, merge it into `devel`, and push `devel`.

   Rationale: `devel` must also contain all the improvements that have been
   applied on `stable`.
