[[!meta title="Release Manager"]]

# Tasks

## In the beginning of your shift

- Send the release schedule to <tails-dev@boum.org> and
  <tails-l10n@boum.org>. Use the [Mozilla release
  calendar](https://wiki.mozilla.org/RapidRelease/Calendar).
- Update [[contribute/calendar]] accordingly.
- Update the due date on [[!tails_roadmap]] accordingly.
- Ask to be added to the `rsync_tails` group on `rsync.lizard`,
  if needed.
- Make sure you have access to the various systems used to do
  the release.

## Around two weeks before the freeze

- Have a look at recent changes in:
  * the [TBB](https://gitweb.torproject.org/torbrowser.git)'s prefs
    (e.g. `git log -p build-scripts/config/*.js`)
  * the [Tor Browser](https://git.torproject.org/tor-browser.git)
    patch that creates `browser/app/profile/000-tor-browser.js`:

        git diff $LAST_IMPORT_COMMIT..$CURRENT_WIP_BRANCH \
           browser/app/profile/000-tor-browser.js

    - `$LAST_IMPORT_COMMIT` is the commit from which we imported the
      Tor Browser patches last time: see our iceweasel's
      `debian/changelog`
    - `$CURRENT_WIP_BRANCH` is the name of the branch the Tor Browser
      folks are working on these days, or the most recent one (for the
      relevant version of Firefox) that can be found in
      their repository, e.g. *tor-browser-24.3.0esr-2*

- Import the relevant changes into our Iceweasel configuration,
  following the normal review'n'merge process.
- In particular, make sure the `general.*` and
  `browser.startup.homepage_override.*` prefs are in sync', in our
  `/etc/iceweasel/pref/iceweasel.js`, with TBB's `pound_tor.js`.
- Have a look at recent changes
  in [Torbutton](https://gitweb.torproject.org/torbutton.git), and
  do whatever is needed to get the fixes we need in the release.
- Have Kill Your TV upgrade I2P if needed. See [[contribute/design/I2P]].

## Make the release happen

No kidding. See [[contribute/release_process]].

# Shifts

The release manager shifts could be done by a team. They start right after the
publication of the previous release to the publication and announcement of the
release they are taking care of, which should be 6 weeks long if everything goes
fine.
