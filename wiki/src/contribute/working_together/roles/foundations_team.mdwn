[[!meta title="Foundations Team"]]

The Tails Foundations Team is responsible for:

* maintaining the core Tails system, which includes e.g.
  - porting Tails to the new version of its upstream foundations, such
    as a new Debian, Tor or Tor Browser;
  - keeping our core code base up-to-date and maintainable, e.g.
    refactor or clean up stuff that has bit-rotted, migrate code that
    would otherwise rely on obsolete technologies;
  - maintaining the ISO build system;
  - doing the _extra_ peer-review and
    [[release management|release manager]] work that corresponds to
    the above bullet points;

* welcoming new code contributors, e.g. when enough mentoring is
  required to put it outside of the scope of the [[release manager]]'s
  duty to review code contributions;

* reviewing code contributions that are on nobody else's plate, e.g.
  those submitted by the [[release manager]], and the translation
  merge requests sent to <tails-l10n@boum.org>;

* checking how important each issue forwarded by Help Desk is, whether
  it's worth documenting it, and validating the workarounds. If it's
  worth documenting the problem and possibly the workarounds, either
  put it on our Technical Writers' plate, or draft something directly,
  or merge a draft proposed by Technical Writer apprentices;

* help triage new tickets that are on nobody else's plate when
  frontdesk isn't in a good position to do it;

* ensuring that development discussions started on
  <tails-dev@boum.org> are followed-up;

* proposing a release schedule for next year once Mozilla's own
  schedule is available (generally during Q3), ensuring everyone
  affected is aware of it and OK with it (e.g. team managers for
  sponsor deliverables), leading this discussion to a conclusion,
  updating the [[contribute/calendar]] accordingly, and asking
  <tails-rm@boum.org> to decide between themselves how they will share
  the [[roles/release_manager]] shifts;

* reviewing'n'merging proposed branches in a timely manner (1 week in
  general, up to 2 weeks if needed in exceptional cases). If a ticket
  is flagged *Ready for QA*, but nobody on the Foundations Team can
  take care of the review'n'merge, it's the Foundations Team's
  responsibility to ask for help. These tickets can be tracked using:

  - the "Release Manager View: VERSION";
  - the
    [Ready for QA, with no assignee](https://labs.riseup.net/code/projects/tails/issues?query_id=194)
    view;
  - [Ready for QA](https://labs.riseup.net/code/projects/tails/issues?query_id=117);

* deal with last minute emergency fixes needed during release process,
  e.g. [[!tails_ticket 14962]];

* if time allows, do whatever code task the project sees as
  top-priority, such as fixing Holes in the Roof, important bugs, or
  implementing a feature that is needed to keep Tails relevant.
