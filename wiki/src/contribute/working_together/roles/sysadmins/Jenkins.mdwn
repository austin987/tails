Configuration
=============

- master:
  * [[!tails_gitlab tails/puppet-jenkins/-/blob/master/manifests/init.pp
    desc="`jenkins` class"]]
  * [[!tails_gitweb_puppet_tails manifests/jenkins/master.pp
    desc="`tails::jenkins::master` class"]]
  * a few Jenkins plugins installed with `jenkins::plugin`
  * YAML jobs configuration lives in a
    [[!tails_gitweb_repo jenkins-jobs desc="dedicated Git repository"]];
    [Jenkins Job Builder](http://ci.openstack.org/jenkins-job-builder/)
    uses it to configure Jenkins
- slaves:
  * [[!tails_gitweb_puppet_tails manifests/iso_builder.pp
    desc="`tails::iso_builder`"]],
    [[!tails_gitweb_puppet_tails manifests/jenkins/slave.pp
    desc="`tails::jenkins::slave`"]],
    [[!tails_gitweb_puppet_tails manifests/jenkins/slave/iso_builder.pp
    desc="`tails::jenkins::slave::iso_builder`"]],
    [[!tails_gitweb_puppet_tails manifests/jenkins/slave/iso_tester.pp
    desc="`tails::jenkins::slave::iso_tester`"]],
    and [[!tails_gitweb_puppet_tails manifests/tester.pp
    desc="`tails::tester`"]]
    classes
  * signing keys are managed with the `tails_secrets_jenkins` Puppet module
- web server:
  * [[!tails_gitweb_puppet_tails manifests/jenkins/reverse_proxy.pp
    desc="`tails::jenkins::reverse_proxy` class"]]

Upgrade policy
==============

Here are some guidelines to triage security vulnerabilities in Jenkins
and the plugins we have installed:

1. Protecting our infra from folks who have access to Jenkins

   → Upgrading quarterly is sufficient.

2. Protecting our infra from attacks against folks who have access to Jenkins

   For example, XSS that could lead a legitimate user to perform unintended
   actions with Jenkins credentials (i.e. root in practice).

   → We should stay on top of security advisories and react more quickly than
   "in less than 3 months".

3. Protecting our infra from other 3rd-parties that affect Jenkins' security

   For example, say some Jenkins plugin, that connects to remote services, has
   a TLS certificate checking bug. This could potentially allow a MitM to run
   arbitrary code with Jenkins orchestrator or workers permissions, i.e. root.

   → We should stay on top of security advisories and react more quickly than
   "in less than 3 months".

Generating jobs
===============

We generate automatically a set of Jenkins jobs for branches that are
active in the Tails main Git repository.

The first brick extracts the list of active branches and output the
needed information:

 - [[!tails_gitweb config/chroot_local-includes/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/tailslib/git.py]]
 - [[!tails_gitweb config/chroot_local-includes/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/tailslib/jenkins.py]]

This list is parsed by the `generate_tails_iso_jobs` script run by
a cronjob and deployed by our [[!tails_gitweb_repo puppet-tails]]
`tails::jenkins::iso_jobs_generator` manifest.

This script output YAML files compatible with
[jenkins-job-builder](http://docs.openstack.org/infra/jenkins-job-builder).
It creates one `project` for each active branch, which in turn uses
several JJB `job templates` to create jobs for each branch:

 - `build_Tails_ISO_*`
 - `reproducibly_build_Tails_ISO_*`
 - `test_Tails_ISO_*`

This changes are pushed to our [[!tails_gitweb_repo jenkins-jobs]] git
repo by the cronjob, and thanks to their automatic deployment in our
`tails::jenkins::master` and `tails::gitolite::hooks::jenkins_jobs`
manifests in our [[!tails_gitweb_repo puppet-tails]] repo, these new
changes are applied to our Jenkins instance.

Passing parameters through jobs
===============================

We pass information from build job to follow-up jobs (reproducibility
testing, test suite) via two means:

 - the Parameterized Trigger plugin, whenever it's sufficient

 - the EnvInject plugin, for more complex cases:

   * In the build job, a script collects the needed information and
     writes it to a file that's saved as a build artifact.
   * This file is used by the build job itself, to setup the variables it
     needs (currently only `$NOTIFY_TO`).
   * Follow-up jobs imported this file in the workspace along with the
     build artifacts, then use an EnvInject pre-build step to load it
     and set up variables accordingly.
