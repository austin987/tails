[[!meta title="Automated ISO/IMG builds on Jenkins"]]

We re-use the [[Vagrant-based build system|contribute/build/vagrant-setup]] we
have created for developers.

This system generates the needed Vagrant basebox before each build
unless it is already available locally. By default such generated
baseboxes are cached on each ISO builder forever, which is a waste of
disk space: in practice only the most recent baseboxes are used. So we
[take advantage](https://git-tails.immerda.ch/jenkins-jobs/tree/macros/builders.yaml)
of the garbage collection mechanisms provided by the Tails
[[!tails_gitweb Rakefile]]:

- We use the `rake basebox:clean_old` task to delete obsolete
  baseboxes older than some time. Given we switch to a new basebox at
  least for every major Tails release, we've set this expiration time to 4 months.

- We also use the `rake clean_up_libvirt_volumes` task to remove baseboxes from
  the libvirt volumes partition. This way we ensure we only host one copy of a
  given basebox in the `.vagrant.d` directory of the Jenkins user `$HOME`.

The [cleanup_build_job_leftovers](https://git-tails.immerda.ch/puppet-tails/tree/files/jenkins/slaves/isobuilders/cleanup_build_jobs_leftovers)
script ensures a failed basebox generation process
does not break the following builds due to leftovers
such as filesystems temporarily mounted by `vmdebootstrap`.

For security reasons we use nested virtualization:
Vagrant starts the desired ISO build environment in a virtual
machine, all this inside a Jenkins "slave" virtual machine.

On lizard we set the Tails [[extproxy|contribute/build]] build option
and point `http_proxy` to our existing shared `apt-cacher-ng`.
