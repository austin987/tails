## Full test suite vs. scenarios tagged `@fragile`

Jenkins generally only runs scenarios that are _not_ tagged `@fragile`
in Gherkin. But it runs the full test suite, including scenarios that
are tagged `@fragile`, if the images under test were built:

 - from a branch whose name ends with the `+force-all-tests` suffix
 - from a tag
 - from the `devel` branch
 - from the `testing` branch
 - from the `feature/tor-nightly-master` branch

Therefore, to ask Jenkins to run the full test suite on your topic
branch, give it a name that ends `+force-all-tests`.

## Trigger a test suite run without rebuilding images

Every `build_Tails_ISO_*` job run triggers a test suite run
(`test_Tails_ISO_*`), so most of the time, we don't need
to manually trigger test suite runs.

However, in some cases, all we want is to run the test suite multiple
times on a given set of Tails images, that were already built. In such
cases, it is useless and problematic to trigger a build job, merely to
get the test suite running eventually:

 - It's a waste of resources: it will keep isobuilders uselessly busy,
   which makes the feedback loop longer for our other team-mates.
 - It forces us to wait at least one extra hour before we get the
   test suite feedback we want.

Thankfully, there is a way to trigger a test suite run without having
to rebuild images first. To do so, start a "build" of the
corresponding `test_Tail_ISO_*` job, passing to the
`UPSTREAMJOB_BUILD_NUMBER` parameter the ID of the `build_Tail_ISO_*`
job build you want to test.

<div class="caution">
Do <strong>not</strong> directly start a <code>test_Tail_ISO_*</code> job:
this is not supported. It would fail most of the time in confusing ways.
</div>

## Jenkins jobs you can safely ignore

The success/failure of the `keep_node_busy_during_cleanup` job does
not matter.

# For sysadmins

## Old ISO used in the test suite in Jenkins

Some tests like upgrading Tails are done against a Tails installation made from
the previously released ISO and USB images. Those images are retrieved
using wget from <https://iso-history.tails.boum.org>.

In some cases (e.g when the _Tails Installer_ interface has changed), we need to
temporarily change this behaviour to make tests work. To have Jenkins
use the ISO being tested instead of the last released one:

1. Set `USE_LAST_RELEASE_AS_OLD_ISO=no` in the
   `macros/test_Tails_ISO.yaml` and
   `macros/manual_test_Tails_ISO.yaml` files in the
   `jenkins-jobs` Git repository
   (`gitolite@git.puppet.tails.boum.org:jenkins-jobs`).

   Documentation and policy to access this repository is the same as
   for our [[Puppet modules|contribute/git#puppet]].

   See for example
   [commit 371be73](https://git-tails.immerda.ch/jenkins-jobs/commit/?id=371be73).

   <div class="note">
   Treat the repository at immerda as a read-only mirror: any change
   pushed there does not affect our infrastructure and will
   be overwritten.
   </div>

   Under the hood, once this change is applied Jenkins will pass the
   ISO being tested (instead of the last released one) to
   `run_test_suite`'s `--old-iso` argument.

2. File a ticket to ensure this temporarily change gets reverted
   in due time.

## Restarting slave VMs between test suite jobs

For background, see [[!tails_ticket 9486]], [[!tails_ticket 11295]],
and [[!tails_ticket 10601]].

Our test suite doesn't _always_ clean after itself properly (e.g.
when tests simply hang and timeout), so we have to reboot
`isotesterN.lizard` between ISO test jobs. We have [[!tails_ticket
17216 desc="ideas"]] to solve this problem, but that's where we're at.

We can't reboot these VMs as part of a test job itself: this would
fail the test job even when the test suite has succeeded.

Therefore, each "build" of a `test_Tail_ISO_*` job runs the test suite,
and then:

1. Triggers a high priority "build" of the
   `keep_node_busy_during_cleanup` job, on the same node.
   That job will ensure the isotester is kept busy until it has
   rebooted and is ready for another test suite run.
1. Gives Jenkins some time to add that `keep_node_busy_during_cleanup`
   build to the queue.
1. Gives the Jenkins Priority Sorter plugin some time to assign its
   intended priority to the `keep_node_busy_during_cleanup` build.
1. Does everything else it should do, such as cleaning up and moving
   artifacts around.
1. Finally, triggers a "build" of the `reboot_node` job on the Jenkins
   master, which will put  the isotester offline, and reboot it.
1. After the isotester has rebooted, when `jenkins-slave.service` starts,
   it puts the node back online.

For more details, see the heavily commented implementation in
[[!tails_gitweb_repo jenkins-jobs]]:

 - `macros/test_Tails_ISO.yaml`
 - `macros/keep_node_busy_during_cleanup.yaml`
 - `macros/reboot_node.yaml`

## Executors on the Jenkins master

We need to ensure the Jenkins master has enough executors configured
so it can run as many `reboot_job` concurrent builds as necessary.

This job can't run in parallel for a given `test_Tails_ISO_*` build,
so what we strictly need is: as many executors on the master as we
have nodes allowed to run `test_Tails_ISO_*`. This currently means: as
many executors on the master as we have isotesters.
