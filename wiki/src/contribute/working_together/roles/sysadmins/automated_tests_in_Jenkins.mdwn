# Force all scenarios to be tested

Branches whose name ends with the `+force-all-tests` suffix will run
the full test suite, including scenarios tagged `@fragile@`.

# Old ISO used in the test suite in Jenkins

Some tests like upgrading Tails are done against a Tails installation made from
the previously released ISO.

In some cases (e.g when the _Tails Installer_ interface has changed), we need to
temporarily change this behaviour to make tests work. To have Jenkins
use the ISO being tested instead of the last released one:

1. Set `USE_LAST_RELEASE_AS_OLD_ISO=no` in the
   `macros/test_Tails_ISO.yaml` and
   `macros/manual_test_Tails_ISO.yaml` files in the
   `jenkins-jobs` Git repository
   (`gitolite@git.puppet.tails.boum.org:jenkins-jobs`).

   Documentation and policy to access this repository is the same as
   for our [[Puppet modules|contribute/git#puppet]].

   See for example
   [commit 371be73](https://git-tails.immerda.ch/jenkins-jobs/commit/?id=371be73).

   <div class="note">
   Treat the repository at immerda as a read-only mirror: any change
   pushed there does not affect our infrastructure and will
   be overwritten.
   </div>

   Under the hood, once this change is applied Jenkins will pass the
   ISO being tested (instead of the last released one) to
   `run_test_suite`'s `--old-iso` argument.

2. File a ticket to ensure this temporarily change gets reverted
   in due time.
