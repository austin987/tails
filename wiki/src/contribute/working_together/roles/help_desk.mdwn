Main purpose
============

Help Desk is handling individual support requests with two primary
goals:

1. Gather qualitative and quantitative user data, that can be used:

   - by the Foundations Team and UX people to prioritize their own
     work;
   - by our broader community, to improve our understanding of who our
     current users are, feed our thought process about our vision for
     Tails in the future, and help us build a relevant roadmap.

2. Help the bug reporter resolve the problem they are facing.

User support
============

  - Do user support by email:
    - Reply to bug reports received on <tails-bugs@boum.org> (empty reports might
      be silently ignored).
    - Reply to private user support requests received on
      [[tails-support-private@boum.org|about/contact#tails-support-private]].
  - Act as a proxy between issues reported by users and the rest of
    the project. Don't spend too much time investigating every such
    issue, in particular for hardware support problems. Instead,
    forward this information to the Foundations Team:
    1. Gather information about the context in which the problem
       occurs, how important it is, what known workarounds exist.
    2. Forward the WhisperBack report over email.
    3. File a ticket assigned to a Foundation Team member, referencing
       the WhisperBack report ID.
    4. Ideally, provide statistics about how many people are impacted.
    5. The Foundations Team will take a look and decide what to do
       (e.g. addressing root cause of the problem, or asking Technical
       Writers to document the problem and workarounds, or dismissing
       it).
  - Follow-up on communications even when not on shift.
  - Do user support on XMPP if you feel like it.

General communication watchdog
==============================

  - Try to do something about the
    [new tickets](https://redmine.tails.boum.org/code/projects/tails/issues?query_id=157)
    that appear in Redmine; if you can't do anything, reassign to
    a Foundations Team member. An Atom feed is available for easier
    monitoring, see the link at the bottom of that page.
  - Administer and moderate our general purpose public mailing lists:
