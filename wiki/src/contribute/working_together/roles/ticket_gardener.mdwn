[[!meta title="Ticket gardener"]]

The aim of ticket gardening is to ensure that items tracked on Redmine stay
relevant and contain helpful information for bringing a task to completion.  To
achieve this goal contributors and teams need to be made aware of the existence
of tickets that need their input so they can self-organize and prioritize their
work. Tickets that are not relevant anymore should be closed.

This work should be done twice per year.

# Tasks

Use existing Redmine views:

* ["Wait" type of work](https://redmine.tails.boum.org/code/projects/tails/issues?query_id=314):
  check if what was blocking was eventually resolved outside of Tails.
  Tickets should either have an assignee, their type of work
  requalified, be rejected, or stay in this state.

* [WIP without assignee](https://redmine.tails.boum.org/code/projects/tails/issues?query_id=141):
  identify tickets that have a majority of work completed and could
  somewhat easily be finished. Create a list of those tickets and send
  them to the responsible team; if that team cannot handle these tickets,
  set _Status_ to something else.

## Tasks to be automated

* The [WIP stalled for a while](https://redmine.tails.boum.org/code/projects/tails/issues?query_id=316)
  view provides an overview to each individual contributor about work that is in
  progress but seems to be stalled.  An [[!tails_ticket
  16545 desc="automated email reminder"]] sends everyone on that list a link to this Redmine view, filtered for
  them, asking them if they think they can realistically come back to it and
  finish the work in the next 6 months.
  If yes, a suitable target version and when relevant, a blocking relationship to the relevant "Core work:
  $team in $quarter"ticket, should be added to the ticket.  If no, contributor should
  clear the _Assignee_ field and bring it to the attention of the relevant team.

* The [Stalled: unblock other people's
  work](https://redmine.tails.boum.org/code/projects/tails/issues?query_id=317)
  view provides to an individual contributor the list of tickets where
  someone has been waiting for a review or for information from them since
  a while. An [[!tails_ticket 16545 desc="email reminder"]]
  regularly suggests contributors to take a look there.
