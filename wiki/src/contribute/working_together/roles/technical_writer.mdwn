[[!meta title="Technical writer"]]

Technical writers are responsible for making sure that the work listed
below happens. This means either mentoring other contributors or acting
as a fallback if no other contributor volunteers to do it.

  - Fixing regressions or important bugs on our
    documentation. This includes tasks identified through:
    - User support on WhisperBack, XMPP, etc.
    - The work of technical writers themselves.
    - The Tails community in general.
  - Redacting release notes based on the
    Changelog excerpts provided by RM.
  - Redacting exceptional publications on our
    blog (security advisory, call for donations, etc.) or reviewing
    them against GDSG and the rest of our documentation.
  - Reviewing contributions of paid workers to our end-user
    documentation (/doc and /support) against GDSG and consistency
    with the rest of our documentation.
  - Maintaining a style guide of Tails-related terms and usage to
    summarizes the terminology decision taken elsewhere.
  - Documenting new features. Documentation writing should be included
    in the budget if the feature has one.

As technical writers have a limited amount of time to dedicate to these
tasks, Tails as a project should redefine priorities on a regular basis.
As general guidelines we should give priority to:

  - Tasks which have to be completed for a given version as
    documentation is a blocker for releasing.
  - Tasks which favor onboarding new contributors, either writing code
    or writing documentation.
  - Tasks that impact users the most or that impact the largest number of users.
  - Tasks that have the highest impact on sustainability.

These tasks are tracked using a "Technical writing for X.Y" parent
ticket on Redmine for each release cycle.
