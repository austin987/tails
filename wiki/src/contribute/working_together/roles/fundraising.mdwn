Fundraising Team
================

The Tails Fundraising Team is responsible for three main activities: Sponsors,
Donations and Grants. They all imply cultivating contacts by sending news about
Tails achievements, plans and needs, and participating to events where these
contacts are.


Sponsors
--------

 - Replying to sponsorship requests, finding new sponsors, seeking donation
   renewal, updating the sponsors page, sending T-shirts.


Donations
---------

 - Carrying out the annual donation campaign
    - Writing blog posts, microblogging messages (AKA tweets) and optionally
      creating a banner
    - Sending a request for renewal to past donors
    - Communicating with the fiscal sponsors receiving donations, to monitor
      the donations
    - Analyzing the donation campaign

 - Improving the donation process
   - Donation forms and webpages, working sometimes with external contractors
     to create visuals
   - Developing means to evaluate the effects of the modifications: A/B
     testing, survey, etc.

 - Replying to donors' requests for information, receipt.


Grants
------

 - Looking for grants and funding opportunities selecting acceptable sources of
   funding, asking summit@ in doubt
 - Identifying match between the grant/donation/contract and Tails roadmap
   items, and making sure we do not deviate from the Tails roadmap and
   prioritize the needs of our users and not our funders
 - Prioritizing grants opportunities, based on Tails needs and capacities.
 - Applying to grants with the support of other teams (Accounting about
   finances, Foundations about workers availability, etc.) and sometimes other
   projects such as Tor
   - Writing the grant: narrative, budget
   - Submit the grant
   - Follow-up: communication with grants and funds organizations and Tails
     members who will implement the grant


Meetings
--------

The Tails Fundraising Team has three types of meetings:

 - Monthly meetings, no fixed date, to maintain social contact between teams'
   members review progresses, do issues gardening and plan the future
 - Proposals preparation with stakeholders (not only from Tails)
 - Donation process improvements, can be with external contractors


Tasks management

The team uses a [dedicated GitLab
project](https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/fundraising) for tasks and issues,
both public and private (when containing strategic or personal information).
