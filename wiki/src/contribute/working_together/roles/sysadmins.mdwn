# Goals

The Tails system administrators set up and maintain the infrastructure
that supports the development and operations of Tails. We aim at
making the life of Tails contributors easier, and to improve the quality of
the Tails releases.

<a id="principles"></a>

# Principles

## Infrastructure as code

We want to treat system administration like a (free) software
development project:

* We want to enable people to participate without needing an account
  on the Tails servers.
* We want to review the changes that are applied to our systems.
* We want to be able to easily reproduce our systems via
  automatic deployment.
* We want to share knowledge with other people.

This is why we try to publish as much as possible of our systems
configuration, and to manage our whole infrastructure with
configuration management tools. That is, without needing to log
into hosts.

## Free Software

We use Free Software, as defined by the [Debian Free Software
Guidelines](https://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines).  
The firmware our systems might need are the only exception to
this rule.

## Relationships with upstream

The [[principles used by the broader Tails
project|contribute/relationship_with_upstream]] also apply for
system administration.

<a id="tools"></a>

# Tools

The main tools used to manage the Tails infrastructure are:

* [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) GNU/Linux; in the vast majority of
  cases, we run the current stable release
* [Puppet](http://projects.puppetlabs.com/projects/puppet),
  a configuration management system
* [Git](http://git-scm.com/) to host and deploy configuration,
  including our [[Puppet modules|contribute/git#puppet]]

<a id="communication"></a>

# Communication

A few people have write access to the puppetmasters, and can log into
the hosts.  
They read the <tails-sysadmins@boum.org> encrypted mailing-list.

We use Redmine tickets for public discussion and tasks management:

* [tasks requiring *Sysadmin*
  work](https://labs.riseup.net/code/projects/tails/issues?query_id=113)
* [tasks belonging to the *Infrastructure*
  category](https://labs.riseup.net/code/projects/tails/issues?query_id=140)

* access: Tails core developers only
* tools: [[!debpts git-annex]]
* configuration: `tails::gitolite` class in [[!tails_gitweb_repo
  puppet-tails]]

## Jenkins

* purpose: continuous integration, e.g. build Tails ISO images from
  source and run test suites
* access: only Tails core developers can see the Jenkins web interface
  ([[!tails_ticket 6270]]); anyone can [[download the built
  products|contribute/how/testing]]
* tools: [[!debpts jenkins desc="Jenkins"]], [[!debpts jenkins-job-builder]]
* configuration:
  - master:
    * `jenkins` class in [[!tails_gitweb_repo puppet-jenkins]]
    * `tails::jenkins::master` class in [[!tails_gitweb_repo puppet-tails]]
    * a few Jenkins plugins installed with `jenkins::plugin`
    * YAML jobs configuration lives in a
      [[!tails_gitweb_repo jenkins-jobs desc="dedicated Git repository"]];
      [Jenkins Job Builder](http://ci.openstack.org/jenkins-job-builder/)
      uses it to configure Jenkins
  - slaves:
    * `tails::builder`, `tails::jenkins::slave`,
      `tails::jenkins::slave::iso_builder` classes in
      [[!tails_gitweb_repo puppet-tails]]
    * some configuration in the manifest ([[!tails_ticket 7106]])
  - web server:
    * some configuration in the manifest ([[!tails_ticket 7107]])

## rsync

* purpose: provide content to the public rsync server, from which all
  HTTP mirrors in turn pull
* access: read-only for those who need it, read-write for Tails core
  developers
* tools: [[!debpts rsync]]
* configuration: `tails::rsync` in [[!tails_gitweb_repo puppet-tails]]

## Tor bridge

* purpose: provide a Tor bridge that Tails contributors can easily use
  for testing
* access: anyone who gets it from
  [BridgeDB](https://bridges.torproject.org/)
* tools: [[!debpts tor]], [[!debpts obfs4proxy]]

    ([[!tails_ticket 6938]])

## WhisperBack relay

* purpose: forward bug reports sent with WhisperBack to <tails-bugs@boum.org>
* access: public; WhisperBack (and hence, any bug reporter) uses it
* tools: [[!debpts postfix desc="Postfix"]]
