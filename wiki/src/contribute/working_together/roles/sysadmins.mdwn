<a id="goals"></a>

# Goals

The Tails system administrators set up and maintain the infrastructure
that supports the development and operations of Tails. We aim at
making the life of Tails contributors easier, and to improve the quality of
the Tails releases.

<a id="principles"></a>

# Principles

## Infrastructure as code

We want to treat system administration like a (free) software
development project:

* We want to enable people to participate without needing an account
  on the Tails servers.
* We want to review the changes that are applied to our systems.
* We want to be able to easily reproduce our systems via
  automatic deployment.
* We want to share knowledge with other people.

This is why we try to publish as much as possible of our systems
configuration, and to manage our whole infrastructure with
configuration management tools. That is, without needing to log
into hosts.

## Free Software

We use Free Software, as defined by the [Debian Free Software
Guidelines](https://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines).  
The firmware our systems might need are the only exception to
this rule.

## Relationships with upstream

The [[principles used by the broader Tails
project|contribute/relationship_with_upstream]] also apply for
system administration.

<a id="duties"></a>

# Duties

## In general

As said above, "set up and maintain the infrastructure". This implies
for example:

* dealing with hardware purchase, upgrades and failures;
* upgrading our systems to a new version of Debian.

## During sysadmin shifts

* create Git repositories when requested
* update access control lists to resources we manage, as requested by
  the corresponding teams
* keep systems up-to-date, reboot them as needed
* keep Jenkins plugins up-to-date, by upgrading any plugin that satisfies
  at least one of these conditions:
   - brings security fixes
   - fixes bugs we're affected by
   - brings new feature we are interested in, without breaking the ones we rely on
   - is needed to upgrade another plugin that we want to upgrade
   - is required by a system upgrade (e.g. of the Jenkins packages)
* report bugs identified in Jenkins plugins after they have been upgraded (both
  on the upstream bug tracker and on our own one)
* act as the de facto interface between Tails and the people hosting
  our services (boum.org, immerda.ch) for non-trivial requests
* when a sysadmin shift includes the beginning of a yearly quarter, ensure that
  sysadmin shifts are filled and agreed on for the next two quarters
* quarterly: self-evaluate our work and report to the -summit@ mailing list
* When the deadline for taking over a given maintenance task (see
  below) has passed, the sysadmin on duty must make it clear s·he's
  handling the problem before starting to work on it, in order to
  avoid work duplication.

## Outside of sysadmin shifts

* Read email at least twice a week to check if the sysadmin currently
  on duty needs help.

* Once 48 hours have passed after a problem was identified, the
  sysadmins not currently on duty can/should take over maintenance
  tasks if the on duty sysadmin is MIA; for critical problems this
  delay shall be reduced.


<a id="tools"></a>

# Tools

The main tools used to manage the Tails infrastructure are:

* [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) GNU/Linux; in the vast majority of
  cases, we run the current stable release
* [Puppet](http://projects.puppetlabs.com/projects/puppet),
  a configuration management system
  - our [[Puppet code|contribute/git#puppet]]
* [Git](http://git-scm.com/) to host and deploy configuration,
  including our Puppet code

Sysadmins can login to all hosts and have write access to the Puppet masters'
Git repositories.

<a id="communication"></a>

# Communication

In order to get in touch with Tails sysadmins, you can:

* Create an issue in the [[!tails_gitlab tails/sysadmin]] project
* Ping all sysadmins anywhere in our [[!tails_gitlab desc="GitLab"]] by mentioning the `@sysadmin-team` group
* See if one of us is on shift in [[one of our chat rooms|about/contact#chat]]
* Send an e-mail to [[the sysadmin's mailing list|about/contact#tails-sysadmins]]

The following lists of issues are also of interest to sysadmins:

* [[!tails_gitlab
  groups/tails/-/issues?label_name%5B%5D=Core+Work%3ASysadmin
  desc="issues that should be taken care of as part of sysadmin shifts
  or are on the sysadmin team's roadmap"]]
* [[!tails_gitlab
  groups/tails/-/issues?label_name%5B%5D=C%3AInfrastructure
  desc="tasks that belong to the *Infrastructure* category"]]

<a id="services"></a>

# Services

Below, importance level is evaluated based on:

* users' needs: e.g. if the APT repository is down, then the
  _Additional Software_ feature is broken;
* developers' needs: e.g. if the ISO build fails, then developers
  cannot work;
* the release process' needs: we want to be able to do an emergency
  release at any time when critical security issues are published.
  Note that in order to release Tails, one needs to first build Tails,
  so any service that's needed to build Tails is also needed to release Tails.

## APT repositories

<a id="custom-apt-repository"></a>

## Icinga2

* purpose: Monitor Tails online services and systems.
* access: only Tails core developers can read-only the Icingaweb2 interface,
  sysadmins are RW and receive notifications by email.
* setup: We have one Icinga2 instance installed on a dedicated system
  used as the master of all our Icinga2 zones. We use a VM on the other
  bare-metal host as the Icinga2 satellite of our master. Icinga2 agents are
  installed on every other VM and the host itself. They report back to
  the satellite, which transmits to the master. We spread the Icinga2
  configuration with Puppet. This way, we achieve a certain isolation
  where the master or the satellite have no right to configure agents or
  run arbitrary commands on them.
* tools: [[!debpts icinga2 desc="Icinga2"]], [[!debpts icingaweb2]]
* configuration:
