User support
============

  - Do user support by email:
    - Reply to bug reports received on tails-bugs@boum.org (empty reports might
      be silently ignored).
    - Reply to private user support requests received on
      [[tails-support-private@boum.org|about/contact#tails-support-private]].
    - Make sure everything is replied on [[tails-support@boum.org|support/tails-support]], while leaving
      space for other people to participate.
  - Improve the list of [[known issues|support/known_issues]] and [[FAQ|support/faq]] incrementally based on the work done by email, and do
    whatever small tasks will make the frontdesk job's easier in the future.
  - Based on users reports, gather information on compatibility in
    between Tails and Mac computers according to [[!tails_ticket 9315]].
  - Do user support on XMPP if you feel like it.

General communication watchdog
==============================

  - Try to do something about the
    [new tickets](https://labs.riseup.net/code/projects/tails/issues?query_id=157)
    that appear in Redmine. An Atom feed is available for easier
    monitoring, see the link at the bottom of that page.
