Is Tails the right tool for me?
-------------------------------

1. First, read the [[about|about]] page to get a basic idea of what Tails is.

2. Then read the [[warning|doc/about/warning]] page to understand **what Tails doesn't protect you
against**, how you can screw up your anonymity or leave traces.

3. If Tails is the right tool for you, go on [[downloading, verifying, and
installing it|download]].

4. Throughout your use of Tails, it's very important to [[stay up to
date|download#stay_tuned]] with security issues and new versions.
