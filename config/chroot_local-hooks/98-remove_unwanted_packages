echo "Removing unwanted packages"

### Deinstall dev packages.

# We use apt-get as aptitude doesn't know about globs.
# There are packages we could be tempted to remove but we can't:
#   - gcc-*-base (libstdc++6 depends on it)
#   - libgcc1 (apt depends on it)
#   - cpp, cpp-* (big parts of GNOME depend on it)
