### Ensure GIDs are stable accross releases
#   ... otherwise, things such as tor@service are broken
#   after applying an automatic upgrade (#15695, #15424, #13426, #15407)

# When installing packages apt may variate the order of package installations.
# That leads to different GID/UID for the created groups and users. This
# variation of GID/UID leads to problems, when we want to ship diffs for a
# smoother upgrade process. There are many different solutions flying around to
# fix this issue, but they were not elaborate for Tails and may have other nasty
# side-effects, as the maintainer scripts, may react differently, if they are
# not in charge of creating group/user themselves.

# We may get rid of this script with the switch to overlayfs (#8415, #15689).
