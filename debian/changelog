tails (0.8.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Iceweasel
    - Update to 3.5.16-10 (fixes DSA-2313-1).
    - FireGPG: force crypto action results to appear in a new window, otherwise
      JavaScript can steal decrypted plaintext. Advice: always use FireGPG's
      text editor when writing text you want to encrypt. If you write it in a
      textbox the plaintext can be stolen through JavaScript before it is
      encrypted in the same way.
    - Update HTTPS Everywhere extension to 1.0.3-1.
    - Stop using the small version of the Tor check page. The small version
      incorrectly tells Tails users to upgrade their Torbrowser, which has
      confused some users.

  * Software
    - Update Linux to 3.0.0-2 (fixes DSA-2310-1, CVE-2011-2905, CVE-2011-2909,
      CVE-2011-2723, CVE-2011-2699, CVE-2011-1162, CVE-2011-1161).
    - Update usb-modeswitch to 1.1.9-2~bpo60+1 and usb-modeswitch-data to
      20110805-1~bpo60+1 from Debian backports. This adds support for a few
      devices such as Pantech UMW190 CDMA modem.
    - Install libregexp-common-perl 2011041701-3 from Debian unstable. This
      fixes the bug: [[bugs/msva_does_not_use_configured_keyserver]].
    - Install hdparm so the hard drives can be spinned down in order to save
      battery power.
    - Install barry-util for better BlackBerry integration.
    - Debian security upgrades: OpenOffice.org (DSA-2315-1), openjdk-6
      (DSA-2311-1), policykit-1 (DSA-2319-1)

   * Protecting against memory recovery
    - Set more appropriate Linux VM config before wiping memory. These
      parameters should make the wipe process more robust and efficient.

tails (0.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rebase on the Debian Squeeze 6.0.2.1 point-release.

  * Tor
    - Update to 0.2.2.33-1.
    - Disabled ControlPort in favour of ControlSocket.
    - Add port 6523 (Gobby) to Tor's LongLivedPorts list.

  * I2P
    - Update to 0.8.8.
    - Start script now depends on HTP since I2P breaks if the clock jumps or is
      too skewed during bootstrap.

  * Iceweasel
    - Update to 3.5.16-9 (fixes CVE-2011-2374, CVE-2011-2376, CVE-2011-2365,
      CVE-2011-2373, CVE-2011-2371, CVE-2011-0083, CVE-2011-2363, CVE-2011-0085,
      CVE-2011-2362, CVE-2011-2982, CVE-2011-2981, CVE-2011-2378, CVE-2011-2984,
      CVE-2011-2983).
    - Enable HTTP pipelining (like TBB).
    - Update HTTPS Everywhere extension to 1.0.1-1 from Debian unstable.
    - Suppress FoxyProxy update prompts.
    - Prevent FoxyProxy from "phoning home" after a detected upgrade.
    - Fixed a bunch of buggy regular expressions in FoxyProxy's configuration.
      See [[bugs/exploitable_typo_in_url_regex?]] for details. Note that none of
      these issues are critical due to the transparent proxy.
    - Add DuckDuckGo SSL search engine.

  * Torbutton
    - Update to torbutton 1.4.3-1 from Debian unstable.
    - Don't show Torbutton status in the status bar as it's now displayed in the
      toolbar instead.

  * Pidgin
    - More random looking nicks in pidgin.
    - Add IRC account on chat.wikileaks.de:9999.

  * HTP
    - Upgrade htpdate script (taken from Git 7797fe9) that allows setting wget's
      --dns-timeout option.

  * Software
    - Update Linux to 3.0.0-1. -686 is now deprecated in favour of -486 and
      -686-pae; the world is not ready for -pae yet, so we now ship -486.
    - Update OpenSSL to 0.9.8o-4squeeze2 (fixes CVE-2011-1945 (revoke
      compromised DigiNotar certificates), CVE-2011-1945).
    - Update Vidalia to 0.2.14-1+tails1 custom package.
    - Install accessibility tools:
      - gnome-mag: screen magnifier
      - gnome-orca: text-to-speech
    - Replace the onBoard virtual keyboard with Florence.
    - Install the PiTIVi non-linear audio/video editor.
    - Install ttdnsd.
    - Install tor-arm.
    - Install lzma.

  * Arbitrary DNS queries
    - Tor can not handle all types of DNS queries, so if the Tor resolver fails
      we fallback to ttdnsd. This is now possible with Tor 0.2.2.x, since we
      fixed Tor bug #3369.

  * Hardware support
    - Install ipheth-utils for iPhone tethering.
    - Install xserver-xorg-input-vmmouse (for mouse integration with the host OS
      in VMWare and KVM).
    - Install virtualbox-ose 4.x guest packages from Debian backports.

  * Miscellaneous
    - Switch gpg to use keys.indymedia.org's hidden service, without SSL.
      The keys.indymedia.org SSL certificate is now self-signed. The hidden
      service gives a good enough way to authenticate the server and encrypts
      the connection, and just removes the certificates management issue.
    - The squashfs is now compressed using XZ which reduces the image size quite
      drastically.
    - Remove Windows autorun.bat and autorun.inf. These files did open a static
      copy of our website, which is not accessible any longer.

  * Build system
    - Use the Git branch instead of the Debian version into the built image's
      filename.
    - Allow replacing efficient XZ compression with quicker gzip.
    - Build and install documentation into the chroot (-> filesystem.squashfs).
      Rationale: our static website cannot be copied to a FAT32 filesystem due
      to filenames being too long. This means the documentation cannot be
      browsed offline from outside Tails. However, our installer creates GPT
      hidden partitions, so the doc would not be browseable from outside Tails
      anyway. The only usecase we really break by doing so is browsing the
      documentation while running a non-Tails system, from a Tails CD.

tails (0.7.2) unstable; urgency=high

  * Iceweasel
  - Disable Torbutton's external application launch warning.
    ... which advises using Tails. Tails *is* running Tails.
  - FoxyProxy: install from Debian instead of the older one we previously
    shipped.

  * Software
  - haveged: install an official Debian backport instead of a custom backport.
  - unrar: install the version from Debian's non-free repository.
    Users report unrar-free does not work well enough.

 -- Tails developers <amnesia@boum.org>  Sun, 12 Jun 2011 15:34:56 +0200

tails (0.7.1) unstable; urgency=high

  * Vidalia: new 0.2.12-2+tails1 custom package.

  * Iceweasel
  - Don't show Foxyproxy's status / icon in FF statusbar to prevent users
    from accidentaly / unconsciously put their anonymity at risk.
  - "amnesia branding" extension: bump Iceweasel compatibility to 4.0 to ease
    development of future releases.

  * Software
  - Upgrade Linux kernel to Debian's 2.6.32-33: fixes tons of bugs,
    including the infamous missing mouse cursor one. Oh, and it closes
    a few security holes at well.
  - Install unrar-free.
  - Do not install pppoeconf (superseeded by NetworkManager).
  - Upgrade macchanger to Debian testing package to ease development of
    future Tails releases.
  - Debian security upgrades: x11-xserver-utils (DSA-2213-1), isc-dhcp
    (DSA-2216-1), libmodplug (DSA-2226-1), openjdk-6 (DSA-2224-1).

  * Protecting against memory recovery
  - Add Italian translation for tails-kexec. Thanks to Marco A. Calamari.
  - Make it clear what it may mean if the system does not power off
    automatically.
  - Use kexec's --reset-vga option that might fix display corruption issues
    on some hardware.

  * WhisperBack (encrypted bug reporting software)
  - Upgrade WhisperBack to 1.4.1:
    localizes the documentation wiki's URL,
    uses WebKit to display the bug reporting help page,
    now is usable on really small screens.
  - Extract wiki's supported languages at build time, save this
    information to /etc/amnesia/environment, source this file into the
    Live user's environment so that WhisperBack 1.4+ can make good use
    of it.

  * Miscellaneous
  - Fix boot in Chinese.
  - Install mobile-broadband-provider-info for better 3G support.
  - Add back GNOME system icons to menus.

    feeds URL.
  - Remove "vga=788" boot parameter which breaks the boot on some hardware.
  - Remove now useless "splash" boot parameter.
  - Fix a bunch of i386-isms.
  - Pass the noswap option to the kernel. This does not change actual Tails
    behaviour but prevents users from unnecessarily worrying because of 
    the "Activating swap" boot message.
  - Make use of check.torproject.org's Arabic version.

  * Build system
  - Enable squeeze-backports. It is now ready and will be used soon.
  - Install eatmydata in the chroot.
  - Convert ikiwiki setup files to YAML.

  - Make configuration more similar to the Tor Browser Bundle's one.
  - GnuPG: default to stronger digest algorithms.
  - Many more or less proper hacks to get the built image size under 700MB.

  * Iceweasel
  - Fixed torbutton has migrated to testing, remove custom package.

  * HTP
  - Query ssl.scroogle.org instead of lists.debian.org.
  - Don't run when the interface that has gone up is the loopback one.

    optional email address and OpenPGP key).
  - Remove mc.
  - Update haveged backport to 0.9-3~amnesia+lenny1.
  - Update live-boot custom packages (2.0.6-1+tails1.6797e8): fixes bugs

  - Fix permissions on files in /etc/apt/ that are preserved in the image.
  - Install version 2.0~a21-1 of live-build and live-helper in the image.
    We are too late in the release process to upgrade to current Squeeze
    version (2.0~a29-1).

  ** SNAPSHOT build @ef28782a0bf58004397b5fd303f938cc7d11ddaa **

  * Hardware support
  - Use a 2.6.32 kernel: linux-image-2.6.32-bpo.5-686 (2.6.32-23~bpo50+1)
    from backports.org. This should support far more hardware and
    especially a lot of wireless adapters.
  - Add firmware for RTL8192 wireless adapters.
  - Enable power management on all wireless interfaces on boot.

  * Software
  - Install inkscape.
  - Install poedit.
  - Install gfshare and ssss: two complementary implementations
    of Shamir's Secret Sharing.
  - Install tor-geoipdb.
  - Remove dialog, mc and xterm.

  * Iceweasel
  - Set extensions.torbutton.spoof_english to its default true value
    in order to workaround a security issue:
    https://amnesia.boum.org/security/Iceweasel_exposes_a_rare_User-Agent/

  * Monkeysphere
  - Install the Iceweasel extension.
  - Use a hkps:// keyserver.

  * GnuPG
  - Install gnupg from backports.org so that hkps:// is supported.
  - Use a hkps:// keyserver.
  - Proxy traffic via polipo.
  - Prefer up-to-date digests and ciphers.

  * Vidalia: rebased our custom package against 0.2.10.

  * Build system
  - Built images are now named like this:
    tails-i386-lenny-0.5-20100925.iso
  - Use live-helper support for isohybrid options instead of doing the
    conversion ourselves. The default binary image type we build is now
    iso-hybrid.
  - Remove .deb built by m-a after they have been installed.
  - Setup custom GConf settings at build time rather than at boot time.
  - Move $HOME files to /etc/skel and let adduser deal with permissions.
  - Convert to live-boot / live-config / live-build 2.x branches.
  - Replaced our custom live-initramfs with a custom live-boot package;
    included version is 2.0.5-1+tails2.6797e8 from our Git repository:
    git clone git://git.immerda.ch/tails_live-boot.git
  - Install live-config* from the live-snapshots Lenny repository.
    Rationale: live-config binary packages differ depending on the target
    distribution, so that using Squeeze's live-config does not produce
    fully-working Lenny images.
  - Rename custom scripts, packages lists and syslinux menu entries from
    the amnesia-* namespace to the tails-* one.

  * HTP
  - Use (authenticated) HTP instead of NTP.
  - The htpdate script that is used comes from commit 43f5f83c0 in our
    custom repository:  git://git.immerda.ch/tails_htp.git
  - Start Tor and Vidalia only once HTP is done.

  * Misc
  - Fix IPv6 firewall restore file. It was previously not used at all.
  - Use ftp.us.debian.org instead of the buggy GeoIP-powered
    cdn.debian.net.
  - Gedit: don't autocreate backup copies.
  - Build images with syslinux>=4.01 that has better isohybrid support.
  - amnesia-security-check: got rid of the dependency on File::Slurp.
  - Take into account the migration of backports.org to backports.debian.org.
  - Make GnuPG key import errors fatal on boot.
  - Warn the user when T(A)ILS is running inside a virtual machine.
  - DNS cache: forget automapped .onion:s on Tor restart.

  * Documentation: imported Incognito's walkthrough, converted to
    Markdown, started the needed adaptation work.

 -- T(A)ILS developers <amnesia@boum.org>  Sun, 26 Sep 2010 11:06:50 +0200

tails (0.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * The project has merged efforts with Incognito.
    It is now to be called "The (Amnesic) Incognito Live System".
    In short: T(A)ILS.

  * Community
  - Created the amnesia-news mailing-list.
  - Added a forum to the website.
  - Created a chatroom on IRC: #tails on irc.oftc.net

  * Fixed bugs
  - Workaround nasty NetworkManager vs. Tor bug that often
    prevented the system to connect to the Tor network: restart Tor and Vidalia
    when a network interface goes up.
  - onBoard now autodetects the keyboard layout... at least once some
    keys have been pressed.
  - New windows don't open in background anymore, thanks to
    a patched Metacity.
  - Memory wiping at shutdown is now lightning fast, and does not prevent
    the computer to halt anymore.
  - GNOME panel icons are right-aligned again.
  - Fixed permissions on APT config files.
  - Repaired mouse integration when running inside VirtualBox.

  * Iceweasel
  - Torbutton: redirect to Scroogle when presented a Google captcha.
  - Revamped bookmarks
      . moved T(A)ILS own website to the personal toolbar
      . moved webmail links (that are expected to be more than 3 soon)
        to a dedicated folder.
  - Don't show AdBlock Plus icon in the toolbar.
  - Adblock Plus: updated patterns, configured to only update subscriptions
    once a year. Which means never, hopefully, as users do update their
    Live system on a regular basis, don't they?

  * Vidalia: rebased our custom package against 0.2.8.
  
  * Claws Mail
  - Install Claws Mail from backports.org to use the X.509 CA
    certificates provided by Debian.
  - Enable PGP modules with basic configuration:
      . Automatically check signatures.
      . Use gpg-agent to manage passwords.
      . Display warning on start-up if GnuPG doesn't work.
  - Set the IO timeout to 120s (i.e. the double of the default 60s).
  
  * Pidgin
  - Automatically connect to irc.oftc.net with a randomized nickname,
    so as not to advertize the use of T(A)ILS; this nickname is made of:
     . a random firstname picked from the 2000 most registered by the U.S.
       social security administration in the 70s;
     . two random digits.
    Good old irc.indymedia.org is still configured - with same nickname -
    but is not enabled by default anymore.
  - Disabled MSN support, that is far too often affected by security flaws.

  * Build $HOME programmatically
  - Migrated all GConf settings, including the GNOME panel configuration,
    to XML files that are loaded at boot time.
  - Configure iceweasel profile skeleton in /etc/iceweasel.
    A brand new profile is setup from this skeleton once iceweasel is
    started after boot.
      . build sqlite files at build time from plain SQL.
      . FireGPG: hard-code current firegpg version at build time to prevent
        the extension to think it was just updated.
      . stop shipping binary NSS files. These were here only to
        install CaCert's certificate, that is actually shipped by Debian's
        patched libnss.
  
  * Build system
  - Updated Debian Live snapshots APT repository URL.
  - Purge all devel packages at the end of the chroot configuration.
  - Make sure the hook that fixes permissions runs last.
  - Remove unwanted Iceweasel search plugins at build time.
  
  * Misc
  - Added a progress bar for boot time file readahead.
  - Readahead more (~37MB) stuff in foreground at boot time.
  - Make the APT pinning persist in the Live image.
  - localepurge: keep locales for all supported languages,
    don't bother when installing new packages.
  - Removed syslinux help menu: these help pages are either buggy or
    not understandable by non-geeks.
  - Fixed Windows autorun.
  - Disable a few live-initramfs scripts to improve boot time.
  - Firewall: forbid any IPv6 communication with the outside.
  - Virtualization support: install open-vm-tools.
  - WhisperBack: updated to 1.2.1, add a random bug ID to the sent
    mail subject.
  - Prompt for CD removal on shutdown, not for USB device.

  * live-initramfs: new package built from our Git (e2890a04ff) repository.
  - Merged upstream changes up to 1.177.2-1.
  - New noprompt=usb feature.
  - Fix buggy memory wiping and shutdown.
  - Really reboot when asked, rather than shutting down the system.

  * onBoard
  - Upgraded to a new custom, patched package (0.93.0-0ubuntu4~amnesia1).
  - Added an entry in the Applications menu.
  
  * Software
  - Install vim-nox with basic configuration
  - Install pwgen
  - Install monkeysphere and msva-perl
  - Replaced randomsound with haveged as an additional source of entropy.

  * Hardware support
  - Build ralink rt2570 wifi modules.
  - Build rt2860 wifi modules from Squeeze. This supports the RT2860
    wireless adapter, found particularly in the ASUS EeePC model 901
    and above.
  - Build broadcom-sta-source wifi modules.
  - Bugfix: cpufreq modules were not properly added to /etc/modules.
  - Use 800x600 mode on boot rather than 1024x768 for compatibility
    with smaller displays.

amnesia (0.4.2) unstable; urgency=low

  New release, mainly aimed at fixing live-initramfs security issue
  (Debian bug #568750), with an additional set of small enhancements as
  a bonus.

  * live-initramfs: new custom package built from our own live-initramfs
    Git repository (commit 8b96e5a6cf8abc)
  - based on new 1.173.1-1 upstream release
  - fixed live-media=removable behaviour so that filesystem images found
    on non-removable storage are really never used (Debian bug #568750)

  * Vidalia: bring back our UI customizations (0.2.7-1~lenny+amnesia1)

  * APT: consistently use the GeoIP-powered cdn.debian.net

  * Software: make room so that {alpha, future} Squeeze images fit on
    700MB CD-ROM
  - only install OpenOffice.org's calc, draw, impress, math and writer
    components
  - removed OpenOffice.org's English hyphenation and thesaurus
  - removed hunspell, wonder why it was ever added

  * Boot
  - explicitly disable persistence, better safe than sorry
  - removed compulsory 15s timeout, live-initramfs knows how to wait for
    the Live media to be ready

  * Build system: don't cache rootfs anymore

 -- amnesia <amnesia@boum.org>  Sun, 07 Feb 2010 18:28:16 +0100

amnesia (0.4.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Brown paper bag bugfix release: have amnesia-security-check use
    entries publication time, rather than update time... else tagging
    a security issue as fixed, after releasing a new version, make this
    issue be announced to every user of this new, fixed version.

 -- amnesia <amnesia@boum.org>  Sat, 06 Feb 2010 03:58:41 +0100

amnesia (0.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * We now only build and ship "Hybrid" ISO images, which can be either
    burnt on CD-ROM or dd'd to a USB stick or hard disk.

  * l10n: we now build and ship multilingual images; initially supported
    (or rather wanna-be-supported) languages are: ar, zh, de, en, fr, it,
    pt, es
  - install Iceweasel's and OpenOffice.org's l10n packages for every
    supported language
  - stop installing localized help for OpenOffice.org, we can't afford it
    for enough languages
  - when possible, Iceweasel's homepage and default search engine are localized
  - added Iceweasel's "any language" Scroogle SSL search engine
  - when the documentation icon is clicked, display the local wiki in
    currently used language, if available
  - the Nautilus wipe script is now translatable
  - added gnome-keyboard-applet to the Gnome panel

  * software
  - replaced Icedove with claws mail, in a bit rough way; see
    https://amnesia.boum.org/todo/replace_icedove_with_claws/ for best
    practices and configuration advices
  - virtual keyboard: install onBoard instead of kvkbd
  - Tor controller: install Vidalia instead of TorK
  - install only chosen parts of Gnome, rather than gnome-desktop-environment
  - do not install xdialog, which is unused and not in Squeeze
  - stop installing grub as it breaks Squeeze builds (see Debian bug #467620)
  - install live-helper from snapshots repository into the Live image

  * Iceweasel
  - do not install the NoScript extension anymore: it is not strictly
    necessary but bloodily annoying

  * Provide WhisperBack 1.2 for anonymous, GnuPG-encrypted bug reporting.
  - added dependency on python-gnutls
  - install the SMTP hidden relay's certificate

  * amnesia-security-check: new program that tells users that the amnesia
    version they are running is affected by security flaws, and which ones
    they are; this program is run at Gnome session startup, after sleeping
    2 minutes to let Tor a chance to initialize.
    Technical details:
  - Perl
  - uses the Desktop Notifications framework
  - fetches the security atom feed from the wiki
  - verifies the server certificate against its known CA
  - tries fetching the localized feed; if it fails, fetch the default
    (English) feed

  * live-initramfs: new custom package built from our own live-initramfs
    Git repository (commit 40e957c4b89099e06421)
  - at shutdown time, ask the user to unplug the CD / USB stick, then run
    smem, wait for it to finish, then attempt to immediately halt

  * build system
  - bumped dependency on live-helper to >= 2.0a6 and adapted our config
  - generate hybrid ISO images by default, when installed syslinux is
    recent enough
  - stop trying to support building several images in a row, it is still
    broken and less needed now that we ship hybrid ISO images
  - scripts/config: specify distribution when initializing defaults
  - updated Debian Live APT repository's signing key

  * PowerPC
  - disable virtualbox packages installing and module building on !i386
    && !amd64, as PowerPC is not a supported guest architecture
  - built and imported tor_0.2.1.20-1~~lenny+1_powerpc.deb

  * Squeeze
  - rough beginnings of a scratch Squeeze branch, currently unsupported
  - install gobby-infinote

  * misc
  - updated GnuPG key with up-to-date signatures
  - more improvements on boot time from CD
  - enhanced the wipe in Nautilus UI (now asks for confirmation and
    reports success or failure)
  - removed the "restart Tor" launcher from the Gnome panel

 -- amnesia <amnesia@boum.org>  Fri, 05 Feb 2010 22:28:04 +0100

  - ntfsprogs
  - randomsound to enhance the kernel's random pool
  * Tor
  - install the latest stable release from deb.torproject.org
  - ifupdown script now uses SIGHUP signal rather than a whole tor
    restart, so that in the middle of it vidalia won't start it's own
    tor
  - configure Gnome proxy to use Tor
  * iceweasel
  - adblockplus: upgraded to 1.0.2
  - adblockplus: subscribe to US and DE EasyList extensions, updated patterns
  - firegpg is now installed from Debian Squeeze rather than manually; current
    version is then 0.7.10
  - firegpg: use better keyserver ... namely pool.sks-keyservers.net
  - added bookmark to Amnesia's own website
  - use a custom "amnesiabranding" extension to localize the default search
    engine and homepage depending on the current locale
  - updated noscript whitelist
  - disable overriden homepage redirect on iceweasel upgrade
  * pidgin
  - nicer default configuration with verified irc.indymedia.org's SSL cert
  - do not parse incoming messages for formatting
  - hide formatting toolbar
  * hardware compatibility
  - b43-fwcutter
  - beginning of support for the ppc architecture
  - load acpi-cpufreq, cpufreq_ondemand and cpufreq_powersave kernel
    modules
  * live-initramfs: custom, updated package based on upstream's 1.157.4-1, built
    from commit b0a4265f9f30bad945da of amnesia's custom live-initramfs Git
    repository
  - securely erases RAM on shutdown using smem
  - fixes the noprompt bug when running from USB

  * fully support for running as a guest system in VirtualBox
  - install guest utils and X11 drivers
  - build virtualbox-ose kernel modules at image build time
  * documentation
  - new (translatable) wiki, using ikiwiki, with integrated bugs and todo
    tracking system a static version of the wiki is included in generated
    images and linked from the Desktop
  * build system
  - adapt for live-helper 2.0, and depend on it
  - get amnesia version from debian/changelog
  - include the full version in ISO volume name
  - save .list, .packages and .buildlog
  - scripts/clean: cleanup any created dir in binary_local-includes
  - updated Debian Live snapshot packages repository URL and signing key
  - remove duplicated apt/preferences file, the live-helper bug has been
    fixed
  * l10n: beginning of support for --language=en
  * misc
  - improved boot time on CD by ordering files in the squashfs in the order they
    are used during boot
  - added a amnesia-version script to built images, that outputs the current
    image's version
  - added a amnesia-debug script that prepares a tarball with information that
    could be useful for developpers
  - updated Amnesia GnuPG key to a new 4096R one
  - set time with NTP when a network interface is brought up
  - import amnesia's GnuPG pubkey into the live session user's keyring
  - do not ask DHCP for a specific hostname
  - install localepurge, only keep en, fr, de and es locales, which reduces the
    generated images' size by 100MB
  - added a hook to replace /sbin/swapon with a script that only runs
    /bin/true
  - moved networking hooks responsibility from ifupdown to NetworkManager

amnesia (0.1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Forked Privatix 9.03.15, by Markus Mandalka:
  http://mandalka.name/privatix/index.html.en
  Everything has since been rewritten or so heavily changed that nothing
  remains from the original code... apart of a bunch of Gnome settings.
  * hardware support:
  - install a bunch of non-free wifi firmwares
  - install xsane and add the live user to the scanner group
  - install aircrack-ng
  - install xserver-xorg-video-geode on i386 (eCafe support)
  - install xserver-xorg-video-all
  - install firmware-linux from backports.org
  - install system-config-printer
  - added instructions in README.eCAFE to support the Hercules eCAFE EC-800
    netbook
  * APT:
  - configure pinning to support installing chosen packages from
    squeeze; the APT source for testing is hardcoded in chroot_sources/,
    since there is no way to use $LH_CHROOT_MIRROR in chroot_local-hooks
  - give backports.org priority 200, so that we track upgrades of packages
    installed from there
  * release: include the Changelog and TODO in the generated images,
  in the   /usr/share/doc/amnesia/ directory
  * software: install gnomebaker when building Gnome-based live OS, to
  easily clone myself when running from CD
  * build system
  - build i386 images when the build host is amd64
  - added a version file: /etc/amnesia/version
  - use snapshot live-* packages inside the images
  - setup timezone depending on the chosen build locale
  - rely on standard live-initramfs adduser to do our user setup
    (including sudo vs. Gnome/KDE, etc.)
  - stop "supporting" KDE
  - allow building several images at once
  - migrated most of lh_config invocations to scripts/config
  - append "noprompt" so that halting/rebooting work with splashy
  - moved our own variables to config/amnesia, using the namespace
    $AMNESIA_*
  * iceweasel
  - default search engine is now Scroogle SSL, configured to search pages
    in French language; the English one is also installed
  - never ask to save passwords or forms content
  - configured the torbutton extension to use polipo
  - installed the CACert root certificate
  - installed the SSL Blacklist extension and the blacklist data
  - installed the FireGPG extension
  - installed the CS Lite extension
  - installed the NoScript extension
  - NoScript, CS Lite: replaced the default whitelists with a list of
    trusted, non-commercial Internet Service Providers
  - configure extensions (add to prefs.js):
    user_pref("extensions.torbutton.startup", true);
    user_pref("extensions.torbutton.startup_state", 1);
    user_pref("extensions.torbutton.tor_enabled", true);
    user_pref("noscript.notify.hide", true);
    user_pref("capability.policy.maonoscript.sites", "about:
      about:blank about:certerror about:config about:credits
      about:neterror about:plugins about:privatebrowsing
      about:sessionrestore chrome: resource:");
    user_pref("extensions.firegpg.no_updates", true);
  - install the NoScript plugin from Debian squeeze
  - delete urlclassifier3.sqlite on $HOME refresh: as we disabled
    "safebrowsing", this huge file is of no use
  - torbutton: install newer version from Squeeze
  * linux: removed non-686 kernel flavours when building i386 images
  * compatibility: append "live-media=removable live-media-timeout=15", to
    prevent blindly booting another debian-live installed on the hard disk
  * software: added
  - gnome-app-install
  - iwconfig
  - cryptkeeper: Gnome system tray applet to encrypt files with EncFS
  - kvkbd: virtual keyboard (installed from backports.org)
  - sshfs (and added live user to the fuse group)
  - less, secure-delete, wipe, seahorse, sshfs, ntfs-3g
  - scribus
  * Tor
  - enable the transparent proxy, the DNS resolver, and the control port
  - save authentication cookie to /tmp/control_auth_cookie, so that the
    live user can use Tork and co.
  - autostart Tork with Gnome
  - Tork: installed, disabled most notifications and startup tips
  - added a restart tor hook to if-up.d (used by Network Manager as well),
    so that Tor does work immediately even if the network cable was
    plugged late in/after the boot process
  * $HOME
  - added a nautilus-script to wipe files and directories
  - bash with working completion for the live user
  * polipo: install and configure this HTTP proxy to forward requests
  through Tor
  * DNS: install and configure pdnsd to forward any DNS request through
  the Tor resolver
  * firewall: force every outgoing TCP connection through the Tor
  transparent proxy, discard any outgoing UDP connection
  * misc
  - set syslinux timeout to 4 seconds
  - use splashy for more user-friendly boot/halt sequences
