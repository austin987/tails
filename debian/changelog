amnesia (0.4.2) unstable; urgency=low

  New release, mainly aimed at fixing live-initramfs security issue
  (Debian bug #568750), with an additional set of small enhancements as
  a bonus.

  * live-initramfs: new custom package built from our own live-initramfs
    Git repository (commit 8b96e5a6cf8abc)
  - based on new 1.173.1-1 upstream release
  - fixed live-media=removable behaviour so that filesystem images found
    on non-removable storage are really never used (Debian bug #568750)

  * Vidalia: bring back our UI customizations (0.2.7-1~lenny+amnesia1)

  * APT: consistently use the GeoIP-powered cdn.debian.net

  * Software: make room so that {alpha, future} Squeeze images fit on
    700MB CD-ROM
  - only install OpenOffice.org's calc, draw, impress, math and writer
    components
  - removed OpenOffice.org's English hyphenation and thesaurus
  - removed hunspell, wonder why it was ever added

  * Boot
  - explicitly disable persistence, better safe than sorry
  - removed compulsory 15s timeout, live-initramfs knows how to wait for
    the Live media to be ready

  * Build system: don't cache rootfs anymore

amnesia (0.4.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Brown paper bag bugfix release: have amnesia-security-check use
    entries publication time, rather than update time... else tagging
    a security issue as fixed, after releasing a new version, make this
    issue be announced to every user of this new, fixed version.

amnesia (0.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * We now only build and ship "Hybrid" ISO images, which can be either
    burnt on CD-ROM or dd'd to a USB stick or hard disk.

  * l10n: we now build and ship multilingual images; initially supported
    (or rather wanna-be-supported) languages are: ar, zh, de, en, fr, it,
    pt, es
  - install Iceweasel's and OpenOffice.org's l10n packages for every
    supported language
  - stop installing localized help for OpenOffice.org, we can't afford it
    for enough languages
  - when possible, Iceweasel's homepage and default search engine are localized
  - added Iceweasel's "any language" Scroogle SSL search engine
  - when the documentation icon is clicked, display the local wiki in
    currently used language, if available
  - the Nautilus wipe script is now translatable
  - added gnome-keyboard-applet to the Gnome panel

  * software
  - replaced Icedove with claws mail, in a bit rough way; see
    https://amnesia.boum.org/todo/replace_icedove_with_claws/ for best
    practices and configuration advices
  - virtual keyboard: install onBoard instead of kvkbd
  - Tor controller: install Vidalia instead of TorK
  - install only chosen parts of Gnome, rather than gnome-desktop-environment
  - do not install xdialog, which is unused and not in Squeeze
  - stop installing grub as it breaks Squeeze builds (see Debian bug #467620)
  - install live-helper from snapshots repository into the Live image

  * Iceweasel
  - do not install the NoScript extension anymore: it is not strictly
    necessary but bloodily annoying

  * Pidgin
  - use "guest" as realname and username as well, so as to avoid
    advertising amnesia usage

  * Provide WhisperBack 1.2 for anonymous, GnuPG-encrypted bug reporting.
  - added dependency on python-gnutls
  - install the SMTP hidden relay's certificate

  * amnesia-security-check: new program that tells users that the amnesia
    version they are running is affected by security flaws, and which ones
    they are; this program is run at Gnome session startup, after sleeping
    2 minutes to let Tor a chance to initialize.
    Technical details:
  - Perl
  - uses the Desktop Notifications framework
  - fetches the security atom feed from the wiki
  - verifies the server certificate against its known CA
  - tries fetching the localized feed; if it fails, fetch the default
    (English) feed

  * live-initramfs: new custom package built from our own live-initramfs
    Git repository (commit 40e957c4b89099e06421)
  - at shutdown time, ask the user to unplug the CD / USB stick, then run
    smem, wait for it to finish, then attempt to immediately halt

  * build system
  - bumped dependency on live-helper to >= 2.0a6 and adapted our config
  - generate hybrid ISO images by default, when installed syslinux is
    recent enough
  - stop trying to support building several images in a row, it is still
    broken and less needed now that we ship hybrid ISO images
  - scripts/config: specify distribution when initializing defaults
  - updated Debian Live APT repository's signing key

  * PowerPC
  - disable virtualbox packages installing and module building on !i386
    && !amd64, as PowerPC is not a supported guest architecture
  - built and imported tor_0.2.1.20-1~~lenny+1_powerpc.deb

  * Squeeze
  - rough beginnings of a scratch Squeeze branch, currently unsupported
  - install gobby-infinote

  * misc
  - updated GnuPG key with up-to-date signatures
  - more improvements on boot time from CD
  - enhanced the wipe in Nautilus UI (now asks for confirmation and
    reports success or failure)
  - removed the "restart Tor" launcher from the Gnome panel

  - randomsound to enhance the kernel's random pool
  * Tor
  - install the latest stable release from deb.torproject.org
  - ifupdown script now uses SIGHUP signal rather than a whole tor

    tor
  - configure Gnome proxy to use Tor
  * iceweasel
  - adblockplus: upgraded to 1.0.2
  - adblockplus: subscribe to US and DE EasyList extensions, updated patterns

  - include the full version in ISO volume name
  - save .list, .packages and .buildlog
  - scripts/clean: cleanup any created dir in binary_local-includes
  - updated Debian Live snapshot packages repository URL and signing key
  - remove duplicated apt/preferences file, the live-helper bug has been
    fixed
  * l10n: beginning of support for --language=en
  * misc
  - improved boot time on CD by ordering files in the squashfs in the order they
    are used during boot
  - added a amnesia-version script to built images, that outputs the current
    image's version
  - added a amnesia-debug script that prepares a tarball with information that
    could be useful for developpers
  - updated Amnesia GnuPG key to a new 4096R one
  - set time with NTP when a network interface is brought up
  - import amnesia's GnuPG pubkey into the live session user's keyring
  - do not ask DHCP for a specific hostname
  - install localepurge, only keep en, fr, de and es locales, which reduces the
    generated images' size by 100MB
  - added a hook to replace /sbin/swapon with a script that only runs
    /bin/true
  - moved networking hooks responsibility from ifupdown to NetworkManager

amnesia (0.1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Forked Privatix 9.03.15, by Markus Mandalka:
  http://mandalka.name/privatix/index.html.en
  Everything has since been rewritten or so heavily changed that nothing
  remains from the original code... apart of a bunch of Gnome settings.
  * hardware support:
  - install a bunch of non-free wifi firmwares
  - install xsane and add the live user to the scanner group
  - install aircrack-ng
  - install xserver-xorg-video-geode on i386 (eCafe support)
  - install xserver-xorg-video-all
  - install firmware-linux from backports.org
  - install system-config-printer
  - added instructions in README.eCAFE to support the Hercules eCAFE EC-800
    netbook
  * APT:
  - configure pinning to support installing chosen packages from
    squeeze; the APT source for testing is hardcoded in chroot_sources/,
    since there is no way to use $LH_CHROOT_MIRROR in chroot_local-hooks
  - give backports.org priority 200, so that we track upgrades of packages
    installed from there
  * release: include the Changelog and TODO in the generated images,
  in the   /usr/share/doc/amnesia/ directory
  * software: install gnomebaker when building Gnome-based live OS, to
  easily clone myself when running from CD
  * build system
  - build i386 images when the build host is amd64
  - added a version file: /etc/amnesia/version
  - use snapshot live-* packages inside the images
  - setup timezone depending on the chosen build locale
  - rely on standard live-initramfs adduser to do our user setup
    (including sudo vs. Gnome/KDE, etc.)
  - stop "supporting" KDE
  - allow building several images at once
  - migrated most of lh_config invocations to scripts/config
  - append "noprompt" so that halting/rebooting work with splashy
  - moved our own variables to config/amnesia, using the namespace
    $AMNESIA_*
  * iceweasel
  - default search engine is now Scroogle SSL, configured to search pages
    in French language; the English one is also installed
  - never ask to save passwords or forms content
  - configured the torbutton extension to use polipo
  - installed the CACert root certificate
  - installed the SSL Blacklist extension and the blacklist data
  - installed the FireGPG extension
  - installed the CS Lite extension
  - installed the NoScript extension
  - NoScript, CS Lite: replaced the default whitelists with a list of
    trusted, non-commercial Internet Service Providers
  - configure extensions (add to prefs.js):
    user_pref("extensions.torbutton.startup", true);
    user_pref("extensions.torbutton.startup_state", 1);
    user_pref("extensions.torbutton.tor_enabled", true);
    user_pref("noscript.notify.hide", true);
    user_pref("capability.policy.maonoscript.sites", "about:
      about:blank about:certerror about:config about:credits
      about:neterror about:plugins about:privatebrowsing
      about:sessionrestore chrome: resource:");
    user_pref("extensions.firegpg.no_updates", true);
  - install the NoScript plugin from Debian squeeze
  - delete urlclassifier3.sqlite on $HOME refresh: as we disabled
    "safebrowsing", this huge file is of no use
  - torbutton: install newer version from Squeeze
  * linux: removed non-686 kernel flavours when building i386 images
  * compatibility: append "live-media=removable live-media-timeout=15", to
    prevent blindly booting another debian-live installed on the hard disk
  * software: added
  - gnome-app-install
  - iwconfig
  - cryptkeeper: Gnome system tray applet to encrypt files with EncFS
  - kvkbd: virtual keyboard (installed from backports.org)
  - sshfs (and added live user to the fuse group)
  - less, secure-delete, wipe, seahorse, sshfs, ntfs-3g
  - scribus
  * Tor
  - enable the transparent proxy, the DNS resolver, and the control port
  - save authentication cookie to /tmp/control_auth_cookie, so that the
    live user can use Tork and co.
  - autostart Tork with Gnome
  - Tork: installed, disabled most notifications and startup tips
  - added a restart tor hook to if-up.d (used by Network Manager as well),
    so that Tor does work immediately even if the network cable was
    plugged late in/after the boot process
  * $HOME
  - added a nautilus-script to wipe files and directories
  - bash with working completion for the live user
  * polipo: install and configure this HTTP proxy to forward requests
  through Tor
  * DNS: install and configure pdnsd to forward any DNS request through
  the Tor resolver
  * firewall: force every outgoing TCP connection through the Tor
  transparent proxy, discard any outgoing UDP connection
  * misc
  - set syslinux timeout to 4 seconds
  - use splashy for more user-friendly boot/halt sequences
